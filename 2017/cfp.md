# Call for Proposals

We are inviting the Julia community to submit talks and workshop proposals for
the upcoming JuliaCon (June 20th-24th, Berkeley, CA, USA).
This Call forProposals closes on **March 25th, 11:59pm SST**.

JuliaCon is the fourth annual Julia community meeting and we encourage everyone
to consider submitting a proposal, regardless of your level of experience with
Julia or as a speaker. 

## Topics

Over the years JuliaCon presentations have ranged from introductory to advanced
and have been from industry and academia. To get a feel for previous years
presentations, take a look at our past programmes and recordings
([2014](/2014/), [2015](/2015/talks.html), [2016](/2016/)).

We are interested in all topics that have to do with Julia and the list below is definitely not complete. 

* Industry applications
* Finance & Economics
* Machine Learning
* Statistics
* Numerical optimization 
* Scientific computing
* Bioinformatics 
* Data visualization
* Julia’s Compiler, Tooling & Ecosystem

The most important consideration is whether **you** think it would be interesting.

## Proposal types

**Talks** are 30 minutes long, with 5 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.  
**Lightning talks** are 10 minutes long, with 2 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.  
**Workshops** are two to three hours long and are either in-depth tutorials or interactive hackathon sessions.  

If you have other ideas or suggestions, like a topic or focus of a hackathon,
please let us know and we will see what we can do.

## Proposal Advice

* Submit proposals early as it allows us to contact you and give feedback to improve
  your proposal if there are any issues with it. 
* When thinking about what makes a good topic, ask yourself what kind of presentation
  would make you or people you know excited. 
* Great talks are generally about your own experience. How do you use Julia in your work?
  What makes a specific package good and how does it work? How does Julia affect you and your code?
  What's holding you back from going all the way? What needs improving? What's your roadmap? 
* It may be a good idea to review previous presentations for inspiration
  and ideas on how to write your title and abstract. 
* If you are presenting about a certain project, package, or company,
  include links to guide the reader to more information. 
* Try not to assume familiarity with your subject when writing the abstract,
  the average reader is most likely not an expert in your area of expertise. 
* Avoid opaque titles, while witty is good, an informative title is essential. 
* Avoid infomercials, while we love to hear how you use Julia in your company
  JuliaCon is not the place to sell your product. 
* If you want feedback before submitting a proposal, contact us at juliacon@googlegroups.com
  well ahead of the deadline. We are more than happy to help you improve your proposal. 

If you have doubts about becoming a speaker, check out the website
[We are all awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/). If you work with Julia in any form we want to hear from you!

We look forward to your proposals and to seeing you at JuliaCon 2017. 

## The fine print
### Submission process

We are using an anonymized submissions process, to avoid selection bias related to the speaker.

### Recordings and Slides
We plan to record all talks and will make them available after conference.
We do this for those who can’t attend, but If you are uncomfortable please let
any member of the committee know. Being recorded is not a requirement to attend
JuliaCon or to give a presentation. Finally, we would also ask you to make your
materials and recording available under a creative commons (default: no commercial reuse)
or other open source license.
