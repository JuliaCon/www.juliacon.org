<h1>Roles</h1>
    <h3>Mentors to new speakers</h3>
    <p>
        JuliaCon 2020 will match first-time JuliaCon speakers desiring guidance to
        experienced speakers willing to mentor. We are expecting a time commitment
        of maximally a few hours in which mentors will provide feedback on a novice
        speaker's presentation.

Please let us know if you would like to be mentored or if you are willing to mentor a first-time speaker for JuliaCon 2019!
    </p>

    <h3>Proceedings reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        JuliaCon will be offering proceedings, and we need
        reviewers to assess submissions. Our review process will be similar to that of
        the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
    </p>
  <h3>Talk submission reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        Once the Call for Proposals closes, we expect to have order of 200 proposals to
        review, each of which will require at least three pairs of eyes. Help us create a
        fair and expedient review process by agreeing to read and score a set of talk
        proposals, and then discuss your evaluation with other volunteers.
    </p>
    <h3>Financial assistance application reviewers</h3>
    <p>
        We are currently looking for volunteers to review financial assistance applications,
        linked from our <a href="https://juliacon.org/2020/faq/">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page. These applications are shorter in length, so we expect reviewers to
        review all applications (about 60) and rate them according to a rubric we will provide.
        If the need arises, we may need to have conference calls to discuss certain cases
        individually.
    </p>
    <h3>Virtual volunteers</h3>
    <p>
        Our virtual volunteers help keep the conference running smoothly by helping with items
        like registration, moderation, and AV support. Help us put on a great event for our community!
