    Linda Petzold is currently Distinguished Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science (Chair 2003-2007), and Director of the Computational Science and Engineering Graduate Emphasis at the University of California Santa Barbara.
    She is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of ACM, ASME, SIAM and AAAS.
    She was named the UCSB Faculty Research Lecturer for 2011, was awarded the SIAM/ACM Prize for Computational Science and Engineering in 2013, received an Honorary Doctorate from Uppsala University in 2015, and was awarded the SIAM Prize for Distinguished Service in 2016.
    She was also awarded the JH Wilkinson prize for numerical software in 1991, and won the 2018 Sidney Fernbach Award.

    Professor Petzold’s research focuses on modeling, simulation and analysis of multiscale systems in materials, biology and medicine. She is best known for her pioneering work on the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Professor Petzold’s software, DASSL and its successor DASPK for the numerical solution of DAEs, is widely used throughout science, engineering and technology.  Her software LSODA, which adaptively determines whether an ODE system is stiff or nonstiff and chooses the appropriate class of algorithms, is also very widely used.
