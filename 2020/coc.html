<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience
    for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
    age, religion, or national and ethnic origin. We encourage respectful
    and considerate interactions between attendees and do not tolerate
    harassment of conference participants in any form. For example, offensive
    or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
    channel, including formal talks and networking between sessions. In 
    general, please abide by the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/). 
    Conference participants violating these standards may be expelled from
    the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

    Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li> Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion
      <li> Sexual images in public spaces
      <li> Sustained disruption of talks or other events
      <li> Unwelcome sexual attention
      <li> Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
    event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the
    event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes
    warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. Event
    organizers may take action to redress anything designed
    to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
    environment hostile for any participants.  We expect participants to
    follow these rules on all platforms used for conference interactions.
    We think people should follow these rules outside event
    activities too!
  </p>

  <h2>Reporting</h2>
  <p>
    If you would like to report a CoC violation or discuss any incident
    that may have left you uncomfortable, please contact one of the
    Discord admins. They may involve other event staff to ensure your
    report is managed properly. You won't be asked to confront anyone 
    and we won't tell anyone who you are without your permission.
