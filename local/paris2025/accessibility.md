# Accessibility

JuliaCon Local Paris is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee.
We want everyone to get the most from the presentations at JuliaCon, whether they're attending in person or watching online. 

Feel free to reach out to the organising committee at \email for any additional concerns.

## Presentation Guidelines

We're aiming to raise awareness of diversity and promote equity for all members of our community. We want to reach everybody in the audience, regardless of vision impairment or other disabilities. So here are some guidelines and suggestions you can follow when building your presentation. These will help make your ideas accessible to everyone.

### Diversity Awareness

Be aware and open to the diversity in your audience. When planning your content understand that
some of your audience might not be able to:
- See well or at all,
- Hear well or at all,
- Move well or at all,
- Speak well or at all,
- Process information in certain formats well or at all.
**_Your audience has both visible and invisible identities and accessibility needs._**

### Best practices for creating an accessible presentation

- Use a simple sans serif font (e.g. Arial, Verdana, or [Atkinson](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible))
- Use a 28 point or larger type. Here is a suggestion for formatting:
  - **Title Text:** 40, bold, centered
  - **Section Headings**, (narrative text), 36, bold, left-justified
  - **Main text** (narrative text), 36, plain, left-justified
- On the intro slide provide a link to your presentation so participants can follow along on their personal devices. _Consider using a QR code for fast access_. To generate a QR Code for your presentation, we recommend: [Thonky](https://www.thonky.com/qrcode/) or [QRCoders.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/QRCoders.jl).
- Each slide should have a title for screen reader navigation. Slide titles do not have to be visible on the slide.
- Minimize the amount of text on slides. When presenting, the text is displayed in a larger size and viewed from a greater distance, making large amounts of text difficult to read.
- Do not use color as the only method for distinguishing information, particularly on charts and graphs. Communicate data in both color and text.
- Make graphics as simple as possible.
- Provide alt-text for all images: [adding alt-text in PowerPoint.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/video-improve-image-accessibility-in-powerpoint-2e7fdfc4-1fa5-4092-be4b-8a4ca592197c).
- Check your presentation for accessibility using bultin feature in your presentation software (e.g. PowerPoint Accessibility Checker).

### Best practices for inclusive presentations

- Allow plenty of time for participants to read each slide. Describe all visual information on the slide, aiming for a ratio of one slide per minute.
- Describe all images, graphs, and charts. Provide a brief description of videos before playing them.
- Be mindful of potential accessibility issues during interactive activities, including Q&A sessions. Use a microphone if available and always repeat questions so everyone can hear.
