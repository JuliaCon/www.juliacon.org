# Call for Proposals

\begin{box}{title="Proposals are open", color="purple"}
  Submit your coolest Julia work on Pretalx before the _extended_ submission deadline (May 30th, anywhere on earth)!
\end{box}

Submission link: **<https://pretalx.com/juliacon-local-paris-2025/>**

We are eagerly awaiting your propositions for talks, posters and tutorials!
Duplicate submissions with JuliaCon Global 2025 are welcome, but acceptance decisions for Paris will be independent from the Pittsburgh ones.

If you would like to be part of the review team, send a message to [paris25@julialang.org](mailto:paris25@julialang.org).
