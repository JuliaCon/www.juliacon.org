  <a name="DataTables"><h3>TypedTables: type-safe data containers</h3></a>
  <em>Andy Ferris</em> (Fugro Roames)
  <p>Julia's dynamic-yet-statically-compilable type system is extremely powerful, but presents some challenges to creating generic storage containers, like tables of data where each column of the table might have different types. This package attempts to present a fully-typed `Table` container, where elements (rows, columns, cells, etc) can be extracted with their correct type annotation at zero additional run-time overhead. The resulting data can then be manipulated without any unboxing penalty, or the need to introduce unseemly function barriers, unlike existing approaches like the popular DataFrames.jl package. 

The main caveat of this approach is the extra layer of complexity for the compiler and programmer introduced by including this information in the type parameters of objects. This talk will explore how additional Julia 0.5 features such as pure functions will significantly simplify both the interface and the implementation of DataTables.</p>

  <em>Arch D. Robison</em> (Intel Corporation)
  <p>For a rewrite of Frequon Invaders, I needed a high performance SIMD kernel for a program written in Go, which lacks SIMD support, but does have a bare-bones assembler. Julia to the rescue! Julia turns out to be a nice language for writing a quick and dirty assembly-code generator.  Subtyping and multiple dispatch enabled concisely describing instruction selection.  Julia being a full programming language enabled some automatic register allocation. The exercise shows the power of Julia to quickly hack a limited “one off” program to generate code.</p>

  <a name="ForwardDiff"><h3>ForwardDiff.jl: Fast Derivatives Made Easy</h3></a>
  <em>Jarrett Revels</em> (MIT)
  <p>Automatic differentiation (AD), a collection of methodologies for computing exact derivatives of programs, is essential for modern scientific computing. In spite of growing awareness of AD, non-expert users face substantial barriers when applying these techniques in practice. These barriers are generally attributable to limitations of the available tools: AD tools developed in low-level languages are difficult to use, and AD tools developed in high-level languages are slow. This talk presents ForwardDiff.jl, a Julia implementation of forward-mode AD that bridges the traditional gap between usability and speed by offering performance competitive with similar C++ implementations. The package leverages Julia's novel performance model to support unique features like black-box function differentiation, simultaneous directional derivative calculation, efficient composability with user-defined types, and experimental parallelism via SIMD/multithreading. The talk will walk the audience through the package's implementation and usage, as well as highlight common AD pitfalls users should avoid.</p>

  <em>Rohit Varkey Thankachan</em>
  <p>ThreeJS.jl is a Julia wrapper around the very popular threejs library for rendering 3D scenes in browsers using JavaScript. This allows the user to create 3D graphics which can be viewed in a browser using just Julia and no HTML or JS. The package can be used along with Escher, IJulia notebooks or from the REPL using Blink.jl. It supports interactivity in Escher, allowing for nice UI’s to interactively update and interact with 3D scenes and also create animations! The talk will demo a few examples to showcase these features and demonstrate the ease of use and presentation quality of web based 3D graphics. ThreeJS.jl was created as part of a JSoC 2015 project mentored by Shashi Gowda and Simon Danisch.</p>

  <em>Abhijith Anilkumar</em> (NITK Surathkal)
  <p>NetworkViz.jl is a graph visualization package that uses ThreeJS.jl and Escher.jl to render graphs. It can be used to create interactive graph visualization applications. Eg. : 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd8LmY2XBHg  2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac3cneCRTZo. The package is tightly integrated with LightGraphs.jl and can be used to visualize graph operations using LightGraphs as shown in example 2. The package works decently fast for graphs with nearly 10000. I'm working on optimizing the performance to make it work with larger graphs.</p>

  <em>Andy Greenwell</em> (Julia Computing, Inc.)
  <p>This talk provides an overview of a consulting project that had two primary goals: 1. Enable the modification of various forward communication root finding and optimization solvers available in the Julia ecosystem to be used as reverse communication solvers, wherein any objective, gradient, or Hessian functions can be evaluated external to the solver itself.  2. Allow for embedding of the Julia solver within a C/C++ application where the objective, gradient and Hessian functions are defined as part of a large pre-existing codebase.  This talk will walk through the specific Julia functionality necessary to enable a variety of forward communication solvers available in different Julia packages to be called in a reverse communication manner, and show how this functionality can be embedded within a C/C++ application.</p>

  <a name="GR"><h3>State of the GR framework</h3></a>
  <em>Josef Heinen</em> (Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH)
  <p>GR is a plotting package for the creation of two- and three-dimensional graphics in Julia, offering basic MATLAB-like plotting functions to visualize static or dynamic data with minimal overhead. In addition, GR can be used as a backend for other plotting interfaces or wrappers, such as PyPlot or Plots. This presentation shows how visualization applications with special performance requirements can be designed on the basis of simple and easy-to-use functions as known from the MATLAB plotting library. The lecture also introduces how to use GR as a backend for Plots, a new plotting interface and wrapper for several Julia graphics packages. By combining the power of those packages the responsiveness of visualization applications can be improved significantly. Using quick practical examples, this talk is going to  present the special features and capabilities provided by the GR framework for high-performance graphics or as a backend for Plots, in particular when being used in interactive notebooks.</p>

  <em>Lars Ruthotto</em> (Emory University)
  <p>Efficient iterative methods for sparse linear systems are crucial in many research and industrial applications, for example, for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). There are different Julia packages that provide implementations of many state-of-the-art linear methods. In this lightning talk, I will give an overview about some of the packages and highlight similarities and differences in coding philosophy. I will also give a detailed comparison of their computational efficiency of  using examples from numerical PDEs. The main goal of the talk is to start a discussion about the inevitable trade-offs between computational efficiency, ease of use and readability of the code.</p>

  <a name="BaseTestAuto"><h3>Finding Julia Bugs Automatically</h3></a>
  <em>Robert Feldt</em> (Blekinge Inst of Technology)
  <p>The ability to thoroughly, but easily, test Julia code and packages is vital if they are to maintain their high quality. The Base.Test framework provides a great set of constructs to help automatically execute test cases and avoid bugs. Recently we have extended this framework with award-winning techniques from our software testing research. Together, these packages enable not only the automated execution but also the automated creation of test cases. This can help you explore the actual behavior of your Julia code to find bugs earlier and increase coverage. In this talk we give an overview of the techniques our extensions provide, and show, with examples, how they have helped us find bugs in Julia code.

Our extensions combine the novel capabilities of a number of different testing frameworks, programming languages and research studies. The BaseTestAuto package provides the basis by extending the Base.Test implementation in Julia 0.5-dev to support repeated execution of test sets and to allow predicates that ensure not only a single but that a whole set of values have a certain property. Another package allows generators for values of any type and structure to be described; this allows for both random and targetted creation of test data. On top of this we can then build a library of generators and combinators to create data that exercises a large part of the Julia type hierarchy. Together these packages extend the type of testing that can now be done in Julia, and in our presentation we will demonstrate random testing, property-based testing, parameterized unit testing, adaptive test execution, and search-based testing for increased coverage and test diversity. Our talk is hands-on and shows the use of these techniques on real Julia code but also outlines future additions that we are working on. Our mission is to make testing in Julia as fun and powerful as possible and we hope to get support from the community in achieving this.</p>

  <a name="Unums2.0"><h3>Unums 2.0: Implementing projective intervals and sets in Julia</h3></a>
  <em>Jason Merrill</em> (Desmos)
  <p>In 2015, John L. Gustafson proposed a new computational representation for sets and intervals of rational numbers called Unums. This proposal provoked both excitement and criticism in the Julia community. Gustafson has recently presented an updated proposal that is a ground-up rethink of how to represent sets and intervals: Unums 2.0. I will discuss a prototype implementation of (some of) this proposal in Julia, and compare it to both the original proposal and other systems of point and interval arithmetic. Two of the most important features of the new proposal are working with the projective rationals (i.e. including a single point at infinity), and making the system of numbers closed under reciprocation (1/x). Working projectively allows including intervals that span the point at infinity, and reciprocal closure means that division can be efficiently implemented as a composition of reciprocation and multiplication. The combination of these allows a simple representation of the reciprocal of intervals that span 0, which is unusual for interval arithmetic. I will also attempt to provide a critical perspective: despite attractive properties, neither proposal is a silver bullet for numerical computing.</p>

  <a name="RCall"><h3>Julia and R: Can't we have both?</h3></a>
  <em>Douglas Bates</em> (U. of Wisconsin - Madison)
  <p>The RCall package allows a Julia user to run an embedded R instance and to communicate with it.  Thus the Julia user has instant access to all the data sets available in R packages and to the data manipulation facilities of R.  For those working on statistical methods in Julia, RCall allows for easy checking of results in Julia against those from R functions. I will illustrate how I was able to use it in developing the MixedModels package.</p>

  <a name="CxxWrap"><h3>CppWrapper: Write Julia modules in C++</h3></a>
  <em>Bart Janssens</em> (Royal Military Academy of Belgium)
  <p>The CppWrapper package helps to expose C++ libraries as a Julia module. The  main difference with Cxx.jl is that the wrappers are in C++ and loaded into Julia as a shared library. This can be useful for large libraries, where the wrapping library can be precompiled. The wrapper can be bundled with the library, automatically ensuring it compiles when updating the C++ library.

In this talk, first the use of the package will be illustrated with a simple example. Next, some aspects of the implementation will be highlighted. The package is based on a combination of ccall and embedded use of the Julia C interface, so this will be explained in detail. On the Julia side, some metaprogramming techniques -used to generate methods- will be shown.

In summary, this talk is targeted at people who are interested in wrapping C++ libraries, want to use the Julia C interface (embedding) or see an example of metaprogramming to define new methods.</p>

  <a name="BoundedIntegers"><h3>Bounded Integers with Type-Level Constants</h3></a>
  <em>David Hossack</em> (Analog Devices)
  <p>I will describe the implementation of a bounded integer type in Julia, where the bounds are encoded as type level constants.  All the usual arithmetic operations on integers are implemented with the result bounds being determined once at (JIT) compile time.  For example adding bounded integers with types BInt{-10,8} and BInt{-100, 20} will yield a bounded integer with type BInt {-110, 28}.

The bounds can be any constant integer, and large bounds are automatically converted to a tuple format that allows extremely large (effectively unbounded) integers to be represented at the type level despite Julia’s current limitation that the type parameter be a “bits type”.  The appropriate value type is determined from the bounds - this can be Int32, Int64, Int128 or BigInt as required.

The implementation exploits @generated functions to make the type level decisions.

The original motivation arose in digital hardware system modeling, but the concept is very general.  The bounded integer “BInt” numeric type behaves like BigInt in that arithmetic on BInt values will never overflow, but without the runtime and storage overhead of BigInt when it can be determined that a fixed width type is sufficient.</p>

  <a name="HPAT"><h3>HPAT.jl - Easy and Fast Big Data Analytics</h3></a>
  <em>Ehsan Totoni</em> (Intel Labs)
  <p>High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT.jl) is a framework for big data analytics on clusters that automatically parallelizes Julia-based analytics programs, and generates efficient MPI/C++ code. HPAT is orders of magnitude faster than systems like Apache Spark. For example, HPAT is 53x faster for Spark’s front-page logistic regression example (200 iterations, 2 billion 10-feature samples) on a 64 nodes (2048 core) system. HPAT is compiler based; it uses Julia’s metaprogramming and ParallelAccelerator under the hoods to apply many optimizations.

I will describe how Julia programmers can take advantage of HPAT,jl and what Julia codes are handled.  We’ll then compare the syntax and performance of HPAT.jl with Spark using examples and discuss how it works internally.</p>

  <a name="PDEs"><h3>Julia and Partial Differential Equations: Being Faster than M*TL*B</h3></a>
  <em>Clemens Heitzinger</em> (TU Vienna)
  <p>We have been developing Julia programs to solve various numerical
problems arising in the areas of deterministic and stochastic partial
differential equations as well as related multiscale problems.  One of
our codes is already available as the Julia package EllipticFEM and
provides a finite-element solver for elliptic partial differential
equations that is faster than MATLAB.  Being faster than the mature
MATLAB implementation underlines the advantages of Julia as a system
combining a native-code compiler with access to state-of-the-art
numerical libraries.

Furthermore, we are using Julia to solve the drift-diffusion-Poisson
system and the Maxwell equations.  These codes will also be published
as Julia packages.  These programs are part of our work to develop new
algorithms for stochastic partial differential equations with
applications in nanotechnology and metamaterials.

  <p>Statistical algorithms are typically based around data fixed in size.  Adapting methods to data which is streaming or too large to fit in memory is often nontrivial.  OnlineStats.jl provides a state of the art toolkit for performing statistical analysis in these situations.

  <a name="FiniteElementAnalysis"><h3>Finite Element Analysis in Julia</h3></a>
  <em>Kristoffer Carlsson</em> (Chalmers University of Technology)
  <p>Writing a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) code requires many components. We typically need a dense and sparse matrix library, linear solvers for both type of matrices, visualizations of the resulting fields on meshes etc. A typical undergraduate course in FEA will therefore use MATLAB as the programming language in which assignments are written. Since students learn FEA in MATLAB this is also what they are likely to use in an eventual PhD project.

I will make the case that Julia can provide an alternative to MATLAB, both when it comes to teaching FEA and implementing FEA codes in a PhD project. We will look at a handful of packages that together with the base Julia library can make writing FEA codes as simple as it would be in MATLAB.</p>

  <a name="Astrodynamics"><h3>Astrodynamics.jl: Modern Spaceflight Dynamics in Julia</h3></a>
  <em>Helge Eichhorn</em> (Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany)
  <p>The motion of a spacecraft is governed by non-linear equations which makes numerical software tools indispensable for the development and operations of a space mission. Since the beginning of computational astrodynamics Fortran has been the language of choice due to the numerical performance requirements. Because Fortran is not exactly flexible and easy to work with many astrodynamicists use Matlab for prototyping algorithms. This has led to the familiar pattern of software tools being implemented twice, first in Matlab then in Fortran, or interfacing Matlab and Fortran through MEX-files and hundreds of lines of glue code.

In this talk I will present the Astrodynamics.jl library and explore how Julia’s unique feature set enables fast and easy modeling of complex space missions while not requiring expensive licenses or juggling multiple programming languages. With Julia it is possible to seamlessly move from simple approximations to parallel high-fidelity simulations which makes it an excellent choice for designing future space missions.</p>

  <a name="LeastSquares"><h3>Least Squares with high dimensional variables</h3></a>
  <em>Matthieu Gomez</em> (Princeton University)
  <p>I will show how to estimate least squares models with high dimensional categorical variables. These models are useful in social sciences because they allow to control for unobserved heterogeneity at a granular level. However, these models are hard to estimate because they typically include a large number of variables.
I will start with linear models with fixed effects. These models require to solve least squares problems on sparse matrices. I will present a new package to estimate such models in Julia, FixedEffectModels.jl. 
I will then discuss linear models with *interacted* fixed effects.These models require to estimate PCAs on sparse matrices. I will present a new package to estimate such models in Julia, SparseFactorModels.jl. 
Finally, I will present a package to solve general high-dimensional least squares problem, LeastSquaresOptim.jl. This package, inspired by the Ceres-solver, is the backend for the two previous packages.</p>

  <a name="ValidatedNumerics"><h3>Precise and rigorous calculations for dynamical systems</h3></a>
  <em>David P. Sanders &amp; Luis Benet</em> (Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM))
  <p>We will discuss why Julia is an excellent environment for developing new
numerical types, using as examples the TaylorSeries.jl and ValidatedNumerics.jl
packages that we have developed.

TaylorSeries.jl calculates Taylor series expansions of functions
around a point in one or more variables by a recursive evaluation of higher derivatives (an extension of automatic differentiation), and, in particular, leads to high-order integrators for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

ValidatedNumerics.jl provides a means to perform *rigorous* calculations using
floating-point arithmetic, with a guarantee of correctness, by calculating with
*sets* instead of numbers, in particular with intervals, and boxes that are Cartesian products of intervals in higher dimensions, that contain the correct result. We can also enclose sets that solve systems of equations and inequalities.

We will show how these ideas can be used to obtain precise and rigorous results for dynamical systems, including iterated maps and ODEs.</p>

  <a name="VinDsl"><h3>VinDsl.jl: Fast and furious statistical modeling</h3></a>
  <em>John Pearson</em> (Duke Institute for Brain Sciences)
  <p>Variational inference is a fast, scalable method for fitting complex statistical models to large and high-dimensional datasets. The repertoire of available algorithms and techniques is expanding rapidly, but most models are still coded by hand. The few automated implementations (e.g., in Stan) face a dual-language problem, and so are less suited to rapid development of new ideas. VinDsl.jl aims to provide a variational inference domain-specific language -- a set of data structures and macros for defining models -- in pure Julia. As a result, existing methods can be mixed and matched and new ones prototyped quickly, creating a thoroughly hackable toolbox for machine learning researchers. In this talk, I'll give an introduction to variational inference and sketch the philosophy and features of VinDsl, ending with applications to some problems in neuroscience.</p>

  <a name="GWAS"><h3>A novel algorithm for model selection in genome-wide association studies</h3></a>
  <em>Kevin L. Keys</em> (University of California, Los Angeles)
  <p>Genome-wide association studies (GWASes) examines phenotypic variation in a sample of patients genotyped at several places on the genome. Since GWASes were introduced in 2005, researchers have performed GWASes for hundreds of traits on thousands of individuals. GWASes produce massive quantities of data that present computational and model selection challenges to their analysis. Prevalent among GWAS analyses is a noticeable failure to explain substantial portions of the observed phenotypic variance. We exploit iterative hard thresholding (IHT) to effectively select genetic markers informative for continuous traits. Preliminary tests suggest that our implementation effectively controls type I errors better than both LASSO- and MCP-penalized linear regression. Our scalable implementation enables GWAS analysis on both desktop machines and computing clusters.</p>

  <p>We relax parametric inference to a non-parametric representation over the Bayes tree, towards more general factor graph solutions. We use Gaussian Mixture models to represent a wider class of constraint beliefs, including multi-hypothesis inference. The Bayes tree factorization maximally exploits the structure of the true joint posterior, thereby minimizing computation. We use approximate non-parametric belief propagation over the cliques of the Bayes tree to reduce the computational complexity. Robotic navigation and mapping is our focused application.

The current version of Mendel consists of more than 75,000 lines of dense Fortran 2008 code. Documentation exceeds 300 pages. Software development in statistical genetics is currently chaotic, and some consolidation is inevitable. The challenge is to accomplish this in a manner that enhances rather than stifles creativity. OpenMendel is an open source project that rewrites Mendel using the elegant and efficient language Julia. Its code base will serve as a platform for the truly large genetics studies now being launched and enables researchers to quickly tailor it to their specific needs.

  <a name="Lora"><h3>Lora: a framework for Monte Carlo methods in Julia</h3></a>
  <em>Theodore Papamarkou</em>
  <p>Lora is a package for Monte Carlo methods in Julia. The package has been supporting geometric MCMC algorithms for the last two years. It has been refactored over the last six months to allow more efficient memory management and execution time by allocating necessary resources at the beginning of the simulation thus avoiding unnecessary reallocations and by using meta-programming to tailor methods to user-defined simulation settings. Furthermore, graphs are used for model specification, Gibbs sampling has been accommodated, output management has been improved and forward as well as reverse mode automatic differentiation capabilities have been added to MCMC samplers.

The roadmap of Lora includes adding documentation for existing functionality, capabilities for state of the art Monte Carlo integration, sequential and variational Monte Carlo algorithms, and other parallel-based MCMC sampling schemes. The overarching goal is to turn Lora into a powerful framework that can be used for tackling challenging applied problems. Along these lines, a contract has been signed with Springer to author a book on Monte Carlo methods with Julia (using Lora), and a collaboration with NASA has been set up for using MCMC inference for exoplanet discovery. Such collaboration will be particularly useful because it entails complex models with constrained parameters, so it will provide further feedback to help Lora meet the challenges of non-trivial applications.</p>

  <p>This talk will describe how researchers in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s DSGE Team use Julia for macroeconomic modeling.  In collaboration with the QuantEcon team, we ported our code for solving dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models to Julia, releasing the source code in the DSGE.jl package in December. DSGE models describe how economic agents behave, given some assumptions about the underlying environment, including fiscal and monetary policy regimes, price rigidities, credit frictions, and various economic shocks.  The FRBNY model is a relatively large model of the U.S. economy, has been used for research on the dynamics of inflation during the great recession, the effects of forward guidance, and much more. 

The DSGE.jl package facilitates the solution and Bayesian estimation of DSGE models. We provide the FRBNY model as one example, but give details on how users can define completely different models.  In this talk, I will give a brief overview of the model and our experience porting the code from MATLAB to Julia (including perspective on using Julia in a "production" setting at a public policy institution). Finally, I will touch on the Julia features our team has found most useful for economic modeling</p>

  <em>Abhijith Anilkumar</em> (GSOC student)
  <p>Graph visualization is one of the fundamental parts of many modern applications like network analysis. Currently, many packages are available in Julia that can be used for visualizing graphs. But all these packages are tailored to work with a specific backend and it is tedious to write separate code for each package as the requirement changes. To tackle this issue, in this project, we will extend GraphLayout.jl (an existing graph visualization package that uses Compose.jl) to be backend-agnostic. The result will facilitate many applications to use the package and switch between backends used to visualize graphs with minimal changes in the code used. GraphLayout.jl will be modified to generate an intermediate Geometric Type, similar to what is discussed in this issue in GeometryTypes.jl using StructsOfArrays. Therefore, any backend that supports this type can be used to render graphs. Completion of this project will eliminate the redundant code present in visualization packages created for different backends.</p>

By taking advantage of Julia's LLVM backend, and detailed benchmarking on package install, I aim to dynamically map Julia functions to the fastest vectorized equivalents available on a specific Julia installation.

The present approach is to manually convert the complex-domain problems to real-domain problems and pass to solvers. This process can be time-consuming and non-intuitive sometimes. The correct approach to such problem would be to make existing packages deal with complex-domain optimization hence making it easier for the optimization community to deal with complex-domain optimization problem.

  <em>Juan Antonio López Mendoza</em> (GSOC student)
  <p>Linear equations and linear algebra in general have a wide range of applications, some of them even critical, for this and other cases really good approximations are required and using the ‘\’ operator is not an option. For this situations iterative solver packages are the way to go, these contain a collection of methods which could be configured to accomplish better and more reliable approximations.

Nevertheless, there isn’t yet a clear common API for these packages in Julia. In some cases when solving equations you would like to have just the approximation, in other cases however you would like more information about the convergence of the iterative process, like the residual norm of each iteration.

There is one last case not present in most linear algebra packages, the ability to query information out of a running method, this would prove most useful when the calculation takes a long time, if it is bound to end at all. This could make the user to feel confused about what is going on and tempting him to end the execution.

  <em>Chris Foster</em> (Fugro Roames)
  <p>Airborne laser scanning provides a good way to create accurate, high resolution, three dimensional maps of large areas. The most basic data product is generally a swath of point sampled geometry below the aircraft, containing a million 3D point samples or so per second of flight. Absolute accuracy and consistency between overlapping flights depends on accurate positioning, with point cloud errors on the order of several centimeters for a typical high end GPS and inertial navigation system.

Accuracy can be further improved by matching point clouds from distinct scans in overlapping areas, using these to infer an improved position solution via a large scale optimization. We have built and contributed to several Julia modules while tackling this problem, including Proj4, Geodesy, and others which we hope to release in the future.

In this talk I present our work on an improved API for Geodesy, showing how Julia’s highly parameterizable types ease the difficulty of working in multiple geospatial coordinate systems. A minimal traits-based system allows users to define their own point types and transform them with Geodesy in a non-intrusive way. As a concrete use case, I’ll present our results from running large scale trajectory optimizations, and demonstrate the improvements with visualizations of some interesting laser scans.</p>

  <em>Ben Lauwens</em> (Royal Military Academy (Belgium))
  <p>Combined simulations, i.e. solving a mixture of discrete-events (implemented as processes or agents) and continuous-time models (systems of differential equations), is a challenging topic. The two paradigms are almost orthogonal and most simulation software is written with one specific purpose in mind. In this talk, I will show how both can fit naturally in the SimJulia.jl package. The differential equations are efficiently integrated with a quantized state system solver. The pitfall of the mainstream ODE solvers, the time discretization, is replaced by a state discretization. The resulting discrete state-machine can easily be implemented as an event-driven model. This allows to make and solve sophisticated models, eg. a pilot ejection system, which are otherwise very hard to do. Julia has some unique features that ease the coding of both the discrete-event kernel and the state quantizer.</p>
