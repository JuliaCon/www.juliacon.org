<p>The computational humanities and social sciences &#40;CHSS&#41; increasingly rely on large, text-rich datasets – from digital corpora and learner corpora to discourse-annotated datasets and historical archives – yet researchers often struggle with the limitations of existing tools for large-scale data processing, modeling, and reproducibility. This minisymposium introduces Julia as a powerful, expressive, and high-performance solution for CHSS research. We showcase how Julia’s strengths &#40;speed, a solid type system, first-class multiple dispatch, and seamless interoperability with Python and R&#41; enable both rapid experimentation and production-grade analysis. Through case studies ranging from corpus statistics and collocation networks to mixed-effects modeling of experimental data and large-scale language data pipelines, we highlight existing Julia packages and other emerging ones such as TextAssociations.jl and demonstrate how Julia can substantially expand what researchers in the humanities and social sciences can achieve. The minisymposium aims to build bridges between Julia developers and CHSS scholars while fostering a new community of users working with rich textual, linguistic, and sociocultural data.</p>

<h3 id="a_hrefhttpspretalxcomjuliacon-2026talkt8c3jrjulia_for_partial_differential_equations_and_its_applications"><a href="#a_hrefhttpspretalxcomjuliacon-2026talkt8c3jrjulia_for_partial_differential_equations_and_its_applications" class="header-anchor"><a href="https://pretalx.com/juliacon-2026/talk/T8C3JR/">Julia for Partial Differential Equations and its Applications</a></a></h3>
<p>Partial differential equations describe the evolution of physical systems in space and time. Realistic models involve the nonlinear coupling of different physical fields, and require their self-consistent solution. Numerical simulation methods involve various space and time discretization approaches which almost certainly lead to sparse nonlinear and linear systems to be solved.</p>
<p>Julia enables efficient composition of partial differential equations &#40;PDEs&#41; solvers through its multiple dispatch, while also offering access to parallel computing and hardware accelerators such as GPUs. The mini-symposium shall discuss various tools and approaches available in Julia which are relevant for PDEs like sparsity handling, automatic differentiation, mesh generation, linear and nonlinear system solvers, parallelization, pre- and post-processing, and visualization. It shall highlight applications from various fields of science and engineering. At the same time, issues like interoperability between different package ecosystems and missing functionality shall be discussed. An open panel will specifically discuss infrastructure needs, identify gaps, and coordinate development efforts to advance the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Nuclear and elementary particle physics increasingly rely on high-performance, composable software stacks to model complex systems, analyze large datasets, and prototype experimental workflows. Julia enables a unique convergence of scientific modeling, performance portability, and long-term maintainability that is difficult to reproduce in Python/C&#43;&#43; ecosystems. JuliaHEP Mini 2026 presents concrete scientific case studies in nuclear physics and particle/astroparticle physics that were developed end-to-end in Julia. These range from experimental simulation to parameter inference, large-scale analysis pipelines, and state-of-the-art visualization. The minisymposium then turns to the engineering aspects that made these results possible: GPU acceleration, HPC integration, domain-specific code generation, interoperability with C&#43;&#43;/Fortran/Python, and lessons from production deployments in research collaborations. Finally, we highlight the organizational and community structures that sustain these efforts. We present embeddings of Julia in larger community initiatives like the HEP Software Foundation, the adoption of their software standards and training activities, which might converge into the building of a JuliaHEP ecosystem. The session is designed for both scientists and technical practitioners seeking to understand why Julia works in physics, how it scales to real collaborations, and what barriers remain for large “C&#43;&#43;/Python first” communities</p>

<p>The purpose of this minisymposium is to showcase recent developments and discuss future challenges in computer algebra in Julia.</p>
<p>In recent years, it has become increasingly common to discover or help prove new mathematical results using symbolic and numerical algebra, as well as polynomial system solving, via packages such as, for example, AbstractAlgebra.jl, AlgebraicSolving.jl, DynamicPolynomials.jl, Groebner.jl, HomotopyContinuation.jl, OSCAR.jl, and Symbolics.jl.</p>
<p>These packages are also gaining popularity beyond pure mathematics, in fields such as robotics, optimization, quantum chemistry, ecology, and machine learning, and now provide key functionality for packages including Catalyst.jl, GameTheory.jl, ParameterEstimation.jl, StructuralIdentifiability.jl, and more. Recent highlights include the development of the OSCAR.jl ecosystem and the integration of HomotopyContinuation.jl into ModelingToolkit.jl.</p>
<p>We invite talks from people using Julia to carry out algebraic computations, either by developing packages or by applying them. The minisymposium aims to showcase both foundational tools and cutting-edge applications across pure and applied mathematics and beyond.</p>
<p>We also welcome submissions of packages and workflows that provide end-to-end solutions to engineering problems, treating these packages effectively as black boxes. Examples include polynomial system solving or parameter estimation. The goal is to lower the barrier to using these tools and to bridge the gap between theorists and practitioners.</p>
