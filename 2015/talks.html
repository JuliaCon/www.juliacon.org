    <p><h2>BioJulia: A modern bioinformatics framework
</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Daniel C. Jones</em></p>
    <p><p>The past decade, DNA sequencing has become dramatically cheaper, faster, and more accurate. Though a revolution for molecular biology research, the increased emphasis on deep sequencing has made bioinformatics software development increasingly inaccessible to non-expert programmers. While Perl, Python, and its ilk were ideal tools ten years ago, the avalanche of data has necessitated a new generation of highly specific standalone C/C++ tools that, while efficient, lack composability and create a high barrier to entry for contributors and reviewers.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia</a> we have begun building a Julia framework for computational biology research that is competitive in performance with C/C++ tools while retaining the accessibility and freedom afforded by traditional high-level languages. With a rigorous testing and code review regime, we have emphasized correctness along with speed, laying the groundwork for a vibrant ecosystem of open bioinformatics software.</p>

    <p><h2>Methods, Models, and Moments: Julian Economics</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Spencer Lyon</em></p>
    <p><p>There was a time when economics focused on elegant models of frictionless worlds, but it’s now well understood that in order for economic models to replicate real world data series they must include many frictions. The field of economics is in the process of moving from a pen and paper science to a highly computationally intensive science. In short, economists are a huge academic community moving into the computational sphere and starting to explore the new generation of programming tools. As such, now is a very promising time for interaction between the Julia and economics communities.</p>

<p>The goal of this talk is to introduce Julia users to some of the distinguishing features of computational economics. Among these are dynamic stochastic optimization, statistical inference and data analysis, and stochastic simulation. We will explore the <a href="https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl">QuantEcon.jl</a> package and how Julia’s expressive type system and advanced compiler make Julia an excellent language for economists.</p>
</p>
     
    <p><b>Bio:</b> Spencer Lyon is a 2nd year PhD student at NYU studying economics. He has a background in physics. Spencer’s research interests are broadly contained in the subfield of macro-economics, with particular emphasis on asset pricing and international modeling. Spencer is a devoted open source hacker who hails from the Python world. He is the main author of the QuantEcon.jl package and one of the core members of the quant-econ team. </p>

    <p><h2>Quantum Statistical Simulations with Julia</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Katharine Hyatt</em></p>
    <p><p>Using high-performance computing to probe quantum systems is becoming more and more common in condensed matter physics research. Many of the commonly used languages and techniques in this space are either difficult to learn or not performant. Julia has allowed us to quickly develop and test codes for a variety of commonly used algorithms, including exact diagonalization, DMRG, and quantum Monte Carlo. Its parallel features, including MPI and GPGPU integration, make it particularly attractive for many quantum simulations. I’ll discuss what features of Julia have been most useful for us when working on these simulations and the developments we’re most excited about.</p>

    <p><h2>Climate classification and clustering with Julia</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Art Diky</em></p>
    <p><p>We investigate an objective approach to classifying world climate. We compare linear manifold and K-means clustering methods to derive a classification of climate types using long-term monthly climate data sets. Climate clusters are compared to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system and analyzed where climate class boundaries change.<br />
Julia language was a main tool used to perform climate data analysis, clustering and reporting. We used Julia to implement the linear manifold (LM) clustering algorithm, LMCLUS.jl, which performs a stochastic search to determine a best location of a bounded LM surrounded by a cluster. Julia provided an outstanding matrix multiplication performance and a parallel computation paradigm which we used in search of a best cluster subspace, along with computationally intensive sensitivity and validation analysis of the clustering results. In our research, we used NetCDF.jl for a data management, Clustering.jl for other clustering methods, Gadfly.jl and RCall.jl for visualizations.<br />

    <p><h2>3D Printing with Julia: Presenting "Euclid", a new high performance multimaterial slicer</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Jack Minardi</em></p>
    <p><p><em>Euclid</em> is a high performance multimaterial slicer written in Julia. At Voxel8 we have developed the first multimaterial 3D printer capable of producing fully functional electronics, and we needed a new slicer to drive it. Julia is used in production at Voxel8 to convert 3D models into a toolpath the printer executes to build up the model in a process known as “slicing”. <em>Euclid</em> is a command line application at its core, but we have put it in a Docker container and written a RESTful front-end to interact with it.</p>

<p>This talk will cover our experiences using Julia in production, using <code>Cxx.jl</code> to interface with C++ libraries, as well as some more general 3D printing concepts like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mesh file formats (STL, OBJ)</li>
  <li>“Slicing” the mesh into layers</li>
  <li>Clipping and insetting</li>
  <li>Thermoplastic extrusion properties.</li>

    <p><h2>GR.jl - Plotting for Julia based on GR</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Josef Heinen</em></p>
    <p><p>Julia is an accepted high-level scripting language for scientific computing and visualization, not least because of the proliferation of libraries such as Gadfly and PyPlot. However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with three-dimensional plotting (OpenGL), the existing graphics packages are too application-specific or seem to be reaching their limits. In particular, large amounts of data or the visualization of three-dimensional scenes may overwhelm the system.</p>

<p>This presentation shows how visualization applications with special performance requirements can be designed on the basis of GR, a high-performance visualization library for Linux, OS X and Windows. The lecture also introduces a new graphics backend for PyPlot based on the GR framework. By combining the power of those libraries the responsiveness of animated visualization applications and their resulting frame rates can be improved significantly. This in turn allows the use of PyPlot in real-time environments, for example in the area of signal processing.</p>

<p>Using concrete examples, the presentation will demonstrate the benefits of the <a href="http://gr-framework.org/">GR framework</a> for high-performance graphics or as a companion module for PyPlot. Based on selected applications, the suitability of the GR framework will be highlighted especially in environments where time is critical. The system’s performance capabilities will be illustrated using demanding live applications. In addition, the special abilities of the GR framework are emphasized in terms of interoperability with OpenGL, which opens up new possibilities for existing applications.</p>

The design and development of visualization systems have been an essential part of his activities over the last twenty years. He is involved in several Open Source projects like GLI or GKS. Most recently his team is engaged with the further development of a universal framework for cross-platform visualization applications (GR Framework).</p>

    <p><h2>Julia as a Probabilistic Programming Language</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Zenna Tavares</em></p>
    <p><p>There has been much debate over Julia’s prospects as a viable language for statistical computing.  In this talk I will offer a more exciting possibility: that Julia is uniquely well positioned for probabilistic programming.  I will present Sigma.jl, a Julia package in which you can specify arbitrarily complex probabilistic models as normal Julia programs; general probabilistic inference procedures then attempt to answer any statistical question you pose about the model.</p>

<p>Researchers typically invent entirely new languages for probabilistic programming.  I will describe how we implement Sigma.jl purely as a package by exploiting Julia’s introspection and multimethod dispatch capabilities to perform static analyses, dynamically.  This allows us, for instance, to use Julia’s existing linear algebra routines over random matrices. I will also outline our algorithmic approach to probabilistic inference, which combines methods from statistics, program analysis and constraint solving, and when combined with Julia enables us to address new classes of probabilistic inference problems.</p>
</p>
     
    <p><b>Bio:</b> Zenna Tavares is a Ph.D candidate at CSAIL of MIT in the Computer Aided Programming group.  Motivated by problems in both human and artificial intelligence, he studies probabilistic programming languages, inference algorithms and the automated synthesis of programs.

    <p><em>Simon Kornblith</em></p>
    <p><p>L1 regularized regression, or the Lasso, is a popular technique for building linear and generalized linear models that selects only a subset of predictors and allows fitting models with more predictors than data points. Modern statistical theory provides a way to determine which of these predictors make significant contributions to the model. I will describe three packages I’ve created that implement L1 regularized regression in Julia: Lasso.jl, LARS.jl, and GLMNet.jl, and compare their approaches and performance.</p>

    <p><p>Naming a child is never easy, and for parents that have different native languages it poses further problems.  Ideally, the name should be equally suitable for both of their native tongues, but how can one find such a name?  In this talk we will take a computational approach and attempt to model the suitability of a name using approaches from Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and, of course, our language of choice, Julia.

    <p><em>Jake Bolewski</em></p>
    <p><p>Julia’s compiler is implemented in three different programming languages, Scheme, Julia, and C/C++. This separation is an issue as it reduces modularity in the compiler and makes implementing new language features and optimizations difficult. As Julia begins to mature, I argue that now is the right time to start thinking about replacing parts of the compiler with Julia code. The most natural place to start is the compiler frontend which is currently written in Scheme. I will demo some work towards rewriting parts of the frontend in pure Julia. I hope to demonstrate that a pure Julia frontend will be beneficial in terms of features, performance, and opportunities for tool integration.</p>

    <p><p>At last years JuliaCon, I presented two highly experimental projects I was working on the Julia C++ FFI, Cxx.jl and an LLDB-based debugger for Julia. Since last year, the C++ FFI has been completely<br />
rewritten based on staged functions, has gained an interactive C++ REPL mode and has reached a<br />
point where it has become useful, not only as a toy research project but has become usable for real<br />
applications. In this follow-on talk, I will demonstrate these new capabilities and explain how to use<br />
them to interact with C++ libraries. Additionally, I will given an update on the (still experimental, but improved) LLDB-based debugger, discussing what features are ready, what problems exist and what the future holds.</p>

    <p><h2>Traits.jl, interfaces for Julia</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Mauro Werder</em></p>
    <p><p><a href="https://github.com/mauro3/Traits.jl">Traits.jl</a> is an experimental package which brings interface/trait/type-class based programming to Julia.  Traits.jl implements two main features: (1) to group types, or tuples of types, into sets (traits) disconnected from the type hierarchy; and (2) to define methods which dispatch on those traits.  The grouping is achieved by specifying certain constraints which a type has to fulfill, typically implementing certain functions but other constraints are allowed too.  For example, a trait <code>Plus{X,Y}</code> could be defined as the set of all type tuples <code>(X,Y)</code> such that a method <code>+(::X,::Y)</code> exists.  Note that this set is (automatically) expanded as new methods to <code>+</code> are added. The dispatch on traits is implemented on top of the normal type-dispatch.  For example, <code>foo{X, Y; Plus{X,Y}}(x::X, y::Y) = ...</code> would define a method which is dispatched to for all <code>(X,Y) ∈ Plus{X,Y}</code>.</p>

<p>I will present the following: a simple example on how Traits.jl works and can be useful; its inner workings; and use-cases in Base and for packages.  I hope to have a discussion on features, roadblocks, a more stable implementation, and whether something like this would be useful for Base.</p>

    <p><h2>Mixing it up: Adventures with statistical models and sparse matrices</h2></p> 
    <p><em>Douglas Bates</em></p>
    <p>
<p>Estimating the parameters in a ‘mixed-effects’ model (also called<br />
‘variance components’ or ‘hierarchical’ or ‘multilevel’) requires<br />
optimizing a log-likelihood.  Until recently it was not possible to<br />
fit models with multiple non-nested sources of variability such as<br />
‘subject’ and ‘item’ or longitudinal data on ‘student’, ‘classroom’,<br />
‘school’, ‘district’, etc.  The introduction of sparse matrix<br />
representations and some clever re-arrangement of terms in the<br />
log-likelihood made it possible to evaluate the log-likelihood by<br />
solving a large, sparse penalized least square problem.  But current<br />
implementations can still take days to optimize this criterion for<br />
complicated models fit to large data sets, because the sparse matrix<br />
methods can’t take advantage of the special structure in the problem.<br />
Because Julia combines the flexibility of a high-level language with<br />
the capability of achieving high performance, it is possible to<br />
exploit these special structures, in many cases reducing the time to<br />
fit a model by one or two orders of magnitude.  User-defined types,<br />
multiple dispatch, in-place evaluation, and devectorization are key<br />
characteristics of Julia for this application.</p>

    <p><p>Full waveform inversion (FWI) is commonly used in geophysical explorations. The goal  of FWI is to estimate a model  (velocity) of the subsurface from measurements of the ground’s responses to seismic vibrations. FWI is known to be a challenging inverse problem that contains many local minima and can be ill-posed.</p>

<p>FWI is computationally demanding:  estimating a model that accurately predicts the measurements requires a large number of simulations each of which is obtained from solving the Helmholtz equation over many sources and frequencies.</p>

<p>This three hours hands-on workshop provides a brief introduction into FWI and the main cornerstones of inversion codes, including:<br />
1. Finite Volume discretization of Helmholtz equation<br />
1. Numerical optimization methods for solving the inverse problem.<br />
1. Parallelization of the optimization problem</p>
