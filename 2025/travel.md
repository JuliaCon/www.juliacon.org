## Local Attractions
Below find an opinionated list of local attractions. For even more, check out [Pittsburgh's tourism site](https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/)!

### Walking Distance from Conference
- **[The Nationality Rooms](https://www.nationalityrooms.pitt.edu/rooms)**: Located in the [Cathedral of Learning](https://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/cathedral-learning) (in which a few of our venue rooms are situated!), these are a series of classrooms decorated with donated artifacts from a wide range of countries, cultures, and ethnic communities. Most of the rooms are in active use as classrooms during the academic year!
- **Carnegie Museums of [Art](https://carnegieart.org/) and [Natural History](https://carnegiemnh.org/) (~5 min walk)**: There are four [Carnegie Museums](https://carnegiemuseums.org/) in Pittsburgh, two of which are right between the CMU and Pitt campuses! Highlights in the art museum include the Hall of Architecture, with plaster casts of notable buildings from around the world, a collection of miniature rooms, and paintings by masters such as Van Gogh and Monet as well as more modern work. In the Natural History Museum, you can find what this local committee co-chair argues is the best hall of minerals and gemstones in the world, as well as tons of cool dinosaurs, dioramas, and more!
- **[Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens](https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/) (10-15 min walk)**: Right on the edge of Schenley Park, Phipps features multiple thematic exhibits, many of which rotate their displays throughout the year. Phipps also features the only LEED Platinum certified greenhouse in the world!
- **[Schenley Park](https://pittsburghparks.org/explore-your-parks/regional-parks/schenley-park/) (10-15 min walk)**: Featuring 456 acres of green space, multi-use trails, and sports facilities, Schenley is a gem of an urban park. At more than half the size of Central Park in New York City, there's plenty of space to escape the urban rush for a walk, trail run, or pickleball game!

### Longer Walk or Accessible by Bus
- **[Carnegie Science Center](https://carnegiesciencecenter.org/) and [Warhol Museum](https://www.warhol.org/) (30-45 min bus or 1+ hour walk)**: Rounding out the Carnegie Museums are the Science Center and Warhol Museum. The Science Center features lots of family-friendly exhibits, but is definitely not just for kids! The Warhol museum will teach you more than you ever needed to know about the life and work of Pittsburgh's own Andy Warhol. These museums are both on the North Side, relatively close to PNC Park, where we'll have our Pirates game outing on Tuesday night!
- **[National Aviary](https://www.aviary.org/) (~40 min bus ride)**: The nation's official bird zoo! Plus a sloth. An excellent time. Also on the North Side.
- **[Heinz History Center](https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/) (30-40 min bus or ~1 hour walk)**: Located downtown, the Heinz History Center has exhibits on many aspects of local and regional history, including slavery and the Underground Railroad, the glass industry, the Heinz company itself, and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum.
- **[Duquesne Incline](https://www.duquesneincline.org/) (30-40 min bus or ~1 hour walk)**: With the steep hill leading up to Mount Washington on the South Side, Pittsburgh used to operate many funnicular railroads that were used daily by commuters. Now, there are just two still in operation. Still part of the public transit system, you can ride up from Carson Street and see a great city view and a small free local history museum at the top, as well as a number of posh restaurants along the appropriately named Grandview Boulevard!

### Wider Region
- **[Fallingwater](https://fallingwater.org/) (1.5 hour drive)**: The iconic Frank Lloyd Wright house offers guided tours of the house and grounds, or just a grounds pass to walk around the scenic property.
- **[Flight 93 National Memorial](https://www.nps.gov/flni/index.htm) (1.5-2 hour drive)**: Memorial located at the crash site of the fourth 9/11 plane that includes a detailed account of the day of September 11, 2001, the heroic actions of the passengers who prevented further tragedy that day, and personal recollections and artifacts.
