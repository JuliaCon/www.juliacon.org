# Hackathon

This year the hackathon will take place in the iconic [Grand Cafe De Lichttoren](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wA2yHBx1Xp8LnqTG6) on Saturday, July 13th. Here you can chat with the friends you made during the previous days of JuliaCon, while in the meantime solving problem of package developers. The following projects are ready to be worked on:

* Implement and test compression for interoperability between JLD2.jl, JLD2.jl, HDF5.jl, and Zarr.jl (Mark Kittisopikul)
* Make Zarr.jl compatible with Zarr version 3 or create a Zarr3.jl (Mark Kittisopikul)
* Create a tarball or zip archive format to aid in Julia package distribution (Mark Kittisopikul)
* Create extension packages to integrate Images.jl with Makie.jl (Mark Kittisopikul)
* Update Napari.jl to work with PythonCall.jl, integrate IJulia into the Napari console (Mark Kittisopikul)
* Create an ImageJ.jl package via JavaCall.jl for ImageJ and Julia interoperation. (Mark Kittisopikul)
