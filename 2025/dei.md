# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at JuliaCon 2024

## JuliaCon Mentor-Mentee Program

A reminder that JuliaCon is running an in-conference mentor-mentee program! Are you a new Julia user or a first-time conference attendee? Are you an experienced Julia community member or multi-conference attendee? If so, sign up to be a mentee or mentor, respectively. We will match attendees based on track and mini-symposium interests, providing new community members with a chance to attend talks with their mentors and gain a foothold in the community. Regardless of whether you already signed up when buying tickets or want to sign up now, **please fill out [this matching form](https://forms.gle/LFyJj8Rg3d2ehKT76) by July 3rd**, one week before the start of the conference!

We will have on-site childcare at JuliaCon 2024 for children between the ages of 0-12. When you purchase your ticket there is an option to sign up for one of the available JuliaCare childcare slots! We hope that this will allow increased attendance and participation from parents of young children. As we approach the conference those who signed up will be contacted with more details. The childcare providers will be on-site Tuesday to Friday. The childcare providers will speak both Dutch and English. 

If you bought a ticket but didn't sign up for childcare and would now like to bring your child, **please sign up using [this form](https://forms.gle/qBBZrCH7AydL2dfLA).**

**All tickets and travel grants have already been awarded for JuliaCon 2024.**

JuliaCon 2024 will attempt provide financial assistance to those who wish to attend but for whom it is financially infeasible. A portion of the sponsorship money will be set aside for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including providing free tickets and travel assistance to diverse attendees. Awards are based on financial need, benefits to the applicant, and contributions by the applicant to their community and the broader Julia community. Financial assistance cannot be guaranteed at this time, but we will do what we can.
