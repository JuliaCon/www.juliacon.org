## Dining

Eindhoven has a variety of restaurants near the city center or close to the PSV Stadium.
Many are within walking distance of the stadium or city center, but there are a few things to consider.


* Spontaneous dining is possible, but not for 30+ people. Be sure to _make a reservation_!
  If you need help ask the organizers.
* Transportation is easier by bike, we recommended to rent a bike if you want to cover more area
* Most places have vegetarian options although a bit limited.
* You can find food near the stadium at "Strijp-S" (pronounces _stripe_ - S) and the city center, which are the larger areas.
  There are other areas called Wilhelminaplein and Victoria Park also close to the stadium, they are a bit smaller but cozier.
  There are other restaurants besides those places, but they might not be at a walking distance (~10min walk), but might be 
  reachable by bike or car ... 
* During weekdays many restaurants will close around midnight or earlier.
* Fridays are generally busy, _definitely_ make a _reservation_!
