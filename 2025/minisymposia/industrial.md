# Industrial Julia

Have you deployed Julia in an industrial setting? Have you tried to teach your colleagues about Julia? We are keen to learn from you about the ups and downs of these experiences.

We are aiming to make this an open session with plenty of room for discussion with the goal of improving the adoption of Julia as an industrial language. This can focus both on actions we can immediately take ourselves as well as on actions that require input from the wider Julia community and/or the Julia core developers.
