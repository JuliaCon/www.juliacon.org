# Quantum minisymposia

## Introduction:
At JuliaCon 2024, we are excited to present a mini-symposium focused on the burgeoning field of quantum software. This event showcases how Julia, as a cutting-edge programming language, is revolutionizing research and applications in various quantum domains such as quantum computing, condensed matter physics, quantum information, and quantum chemistry.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this symposium is to foster a community where the latest software developments in quantum sciences can be shared and discussed. We aim to highlight the role of Julia in facilitating these advancements, providing a platform for showcasing innovative software solutions, discussing challenges, and exploring future possibilities in quantum research.

## Target Audience:
This call is open to researchers, developers, and students who are at
the forefront of integrating software, especially Julia, into quantum
science research and applications. Whether you are developing new
quantum algorithms, exploring quantum-chemical simulations, or
applying Julia in novel quantum contexts, your insights are invaluable.

## Topics of Interest:
We encourage submissions that cover a broad spectrum of quantum software topics, including but not limited to:

Software for quantum algorithm development and simulations
Case studies of Julia in quantum computing applications
Advances in software for quantum information processing
Julia applied to the design, optimization, and control of quantum hardware
Julia-based tools and libraries for quantum many-body physics research
Development of quantum-chemical tools in chemistry and materials science
Interfaces and libraries for atomistic modeling
Benefits of Participation:
Contributors will have the opportunity to engage with a global network of quantum software enthusiasts and professionals, gain visibility for their work, and contribute to advancing the field. The symposium serves as a platform for knowledge exchange, collaboration, and inspiration.

## Conclusion:
Your participation in the JuliaCon 2024 Minisymposium will help shape the future of quantum software. We look forward to your innovative contributions and the exciting discussions they will spark.
