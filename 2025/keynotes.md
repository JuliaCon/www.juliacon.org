### Challenges and Opportunities of Digital Twins

Digital twins have been used to model complex physical systems to predict their behaviour accurately. In this talk, I will present the concept of a hybrid digital twin on the Industrial Metaverse that combines AI/ML based analytics and physics-based simulation to build digital twins that are very accurate, require less training data, and drive high operational efficiency, illustrating how a platform such as JuliaHub can be used to build hybrid digital twins.

### An AI Agenda to Modernize Healthcare Operations

Healthcare systems face numerous challenges in operating efficiently and serving the needs of our patients and communities, including problems with healthcare access, quality, and safety. In this talk, Dr. Singh will address why these operational challenges have been difficult to solve with technology before, and how we should rethink our approaches to these problems using computational methods like generative AI and simulation.
