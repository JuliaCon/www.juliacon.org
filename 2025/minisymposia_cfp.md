# Call for Minisymposia Proposals

We are inviting the Julia community to submit proposals to organize a minisymposium at the upcoming JuliCon'25.

A minisymposium is a “conference-within-a-conference” where the organizers are responsible for scheduling speakers, panels, and discussions as they see fit. JuliaCon has traditionally had minisymposia on topics related to various fields, including high performance computing, quantum computing, Julia in life sciences, and many others. 

For more details, please refer to the CFP here: [Minisymposium CFP](https://pretalx.com/juliacon-2025/cfp)

This Call for Minisymposia Proposals will close on December 1st 2024 23:59 (CET).

If you have any questions, please email us at juliacon@julialang.org
