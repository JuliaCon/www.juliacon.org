#### FAQ:

- **What is the room layout?** The rooms available to purchase are apartment style with 4 bedrooms and a common living space. Each bedroom has it's own key to access, however the bathroom is shared with 3 other attendees.

- **How are roommates selected?** At this time we have not determined the method for roommate selection. As we approach JuliaCon we will send out a form to all UPitt housing guests to gather demographic information and roommate preferences.

- **Is there a traditional hotel block?** At this time we are only offering UPitt housing. We may release additional information about discounted hotel offerings in the area, however we do not anticipate a JuliaCon sponsored hotel block at this time.

- **Do I need a ticket to purchase housing?** Yes. Anyone who registers for UPitt housing and does not have a ticket under the same name / email by July 1 will be warned, followed by a cancellation of their housing purchase.

- **Is there air conditioning?** Yes, all rooms have air conditioning.

- **Where is the housing?** While exact buildings have yet to be assigned more information about the housing complex can be found here: [https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens](https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/bouquet-gardens)
