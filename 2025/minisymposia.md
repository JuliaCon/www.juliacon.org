# Minisymposia

A minisymposium is a conference within a conference. Here are the minisymposia accepting submissions. If your talk fits one of the themes below, consider submitting there instead of to the main JuliaCon track. Note that submissions rejected by minisymposia organizers will still be considered for the main JuliaCon track, hence there is no penalty in submitting to a minisymposium.


## How to submit to a minisymposium

Minisymposia accepting submissions are tracks in the pretalx system. Simply choose the minisymposium from the
"tracks" field when submitting.

## List of Minisymposia

**Note**: Here only the minisymposia accepting submissions are listed.

### Computational Chemistry and Materials Science Minisymposium

The Computational Chemistry and Materials Science Minisymposium brings together researchers, developers, and practitioners to discuss the latest advances in computational chemistry, with a particular emphasis on the integration of modern tools, algorithms, and frameworks to tackle molecular and materials modeling challenges. This year’s symposium will include contributions from across the computational chemistry community, with a dedicated spotlight on the JuliaMolSim ecosystem and its impact.

### Methods and Applications of Scientific Machine Learning

Scientific machine learning (SciML) methods are techniques which incorporate machine learning with mechanistic modeling. The purpose of this minisymposium is to share improved methods and applications of SciML to showcase the ever advancing ecosystem in Julia.

### The State and Future of Julia I/O

The Julia I/O minisymposium will discuss the low-level details of Julia's input and output ecosystem and its interactions with the Julia Data ecosystem. The ability for Julia to read in and then write out data efficiently is critical to doing data science and scientific computing. Julia is unique in terms of input and output in that the language combines both dynamism and a parametric type system. In order for high-level data storage to succeed, a strong I/O foundation is required.

### Quantum Minisymposium

We propose a JuliaCon 2024 minisymposium focused on quantum computing and other emerging quantum technologies. Quantum researchers and engineers are increasingly adopting Julia for their daily tasks. The Julia language is the fastest growing segment of the quantum software ecosystem and is used by 15% of quantum developers, according to the annual report on the state of quantum open source software by the Unitary Fund.

### The JuliaHealth Mini-Symposium

JuliaHealth has a growing library of packages for improving medicine, healthcare, public health, and biomedical research. This mini-symposium will showcase the current state of Julia in these areas with a focus on getting started with Julia for research, tutorials, reproducibility, interoperability, and applications.

### Symbolic-Numeric Computing and Compiler-Enhanced Algorithms

Symbolic-numeric methods are methods which involve symbolic steps to improve beyond what typical "purely numerical methods" can do. This includes the now classic automatic differentiation method, but also methods such as nonlinear tearing, Pantelides algorithm for DAEs, and more. The purpose of this minisymposium is to share the improvements in this special field to showcase the advancements enabled by the robust Julia ecosystem for domain-specific compilation as part of numerical methods.

### Recreational Julia	

You've done something with Julia that doesn't feel serious enough to go in the main conference? You just had a little bit of fun on the side? We want to have fun with you!

You're using Julia to create pretty pictures? We want to see them!
You've developed a sound synthesizer in Julia? We want to hear it!
You're creating a game in Julia? We want to play it.
You're building a robot and Julia controls this beast? We want to ride it!

Join us and get inspired to use Julia in your off-hours.

### Sparse & Graph Computing in Julia

Sparse methods are an increasingly important subsection of numerical computing algorithms. As datasets continue to grow many scientific and business problems become computationally infeasible without harnessing sparsity across the entire pipeline from input datasets, to intermediate results and final outputs. This minisymposium will bring together users and developers of Julia's sparse ecosystem to present on recent advances, identify capability gaps, and discuss the future of the ecosystem.

### Julia in Astronomy & Astrophysics Research 2025

This minisymposium aims to provide researchers in astronomy and astrophysics an opportunity to share how Julia has enhanced their science and the challenges they see to broader adoption. We aim to: (1) raise awareness of Julia programming patterns and packages that are particularly useful for astronomical research, (2) to identify opportunities for new/upgraded packages that could accelerate the adoption of Julia among the astronomical research community, and (3) to help strengthen the community

### Julia for High-Performance Computing

The Julia for High-Performance Computing (HPC) mini-symposium is one of the main events of the year for the Julia for HPC community, bringing together HPC and Julia experts to present and discuss recent advances that make Julia a powerful language driving productivity on all HPC systems ranging from university clusters, to some of the world's most powerful Supercomputers.

### Climate science & solutions: Collaboration & coupling in Julia

The use of Julia for earth and climate modeling is growing rapidly. This expansion calls for a discussion on best practices for simulation and model design to take advantage of Julia language features to make ecosystem code as accessible, intuitive, and extensible as possible. Talks are encouraged to discuss both innovative model architectures and coupling methods, as well as use-cases in the climate solution and education spaces.

### Toward a synthesis of automatic differentiation algorithms

Julia has a rich AD ecosystem: ForwardDiff, ReverseDiff, Enzyme, Zygote, FastDifferentiation, Symbolics, ChainRules, DiffRules, etc. Each AD algorithm is best for a subset of problems but no one algorithm is good for all problems. This minisymposium is an opportunity for AD practitioners to explore the fundamental underlying similarities between these algorithms and to begin to design new hybrid algorithms to address the weakness of existing algorithms.

### Julia for Neuroscience

"Julia for Neuroscience" brings together leading researchers to explore Julia's potential in advancing computational neuroscience. This mini-symposium will showcase Julia's advantages in performance and ease of use compared to traditional C++/Python implementations, featuring talks on neuroimaging analysis, high-performance image processing, and computational modeling. Join us to discuss how Julia can transform neuroscientific computing workflows.

### JuliaGPU minisymposium 

The JuliaGPU community has been a strong presence at JuliaCon for many years. We have held birds of feather sessions, workshops, and presented many talks both on core GPU packages and applications in various fields. In 2025, we propose to organize a minisymposium specifically focused on GPUs. Naturally, this would be closely related to an HPC minisymposium, but the numbers of GPU developers and users justify a sustained focus on the various targets (AMD, Nvidia, Intel, Metal).

### Continued Advancements in Solving Differential Equations

DifferentialEquations.jl has a robust ecosystem not just of solvers and users, but also continued research. In this symposium we will talk about the translational research of bringing new differential equation solvers into fast and reliable software. This will include advancements in Runge-Kutta methods for non-stiff equations, new adaptive Radau techniques for stiff equations, advancements in ODE solvers that exploit parallelism, solvers for boundary value problems (BVPs), and much much more.

### Engineering with Julia

The “Engineering with Julia” minisymposium aims to bring together researchers, industry professionals, and educators to showcase Julia's contributions to engineering. We will explore its transformative potential for enhancing infrastructure, advancing reliability, and promoting sustainability in the context of modern engineering solutions. We also aim to provide a platform for open discussion on the computational tools that engineers rely on in today’s research, practice, and education.

### Multithreading in Julia

An overview of current multithreading capabilities in Julia and future desired interfaces to better express multi-threaded computation.
