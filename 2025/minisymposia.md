# Minisymposia

A minisymposium is a conference within a conference. Here are the minisymposia accepting submissions. If your talk fits one of the themes below, consider submitting there instead of to the main JuliaCon track. Note that submissions rejected by minisymposia organizers will still be considered for the main JuliaCon track, hence there is no penalty in submitting to a minisymposium.


## How to submit to a minisymposium

Minisymposia accepting submissions are tracks in the pretalx system. Simply choose the minisymposium from the
"tracks" field when submitting.
