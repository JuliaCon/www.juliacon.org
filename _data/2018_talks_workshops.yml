  type: talk
  abstract: >
    The web is eating the world, but building modern web applications can be an intimidating task. Successful online products must be fast, beautiful and usable. Responsive, maintainable and extendable. Provide simple and flexible web APIs. Be secure. Reach virtually 100% uptime while being easy to debug, extend and update, requiring powerful logging, intelligent caching and rapid scaling strategies.

    Julia as a language has an enormous potential in the web space thanks to its concise and friendly syntax, the powerful REPL, Unicode support, cross-platform availability, the efficiently compiled code and its parallel and distributed computing capabilities. And Julia's ecosystem already provides low level libraries like HttpServer and WebSockets. But they leave the developers having to spend large amounts of time writing glue and boilerplate code: a tedious, expensive and error prone task.

    Genie is a new web framework that leverages Julia's unique combination of features and its extensive collection of packages to empower developers to create high-performance web apps in less time and with less code. It glues low level libraries and contributes its own middlewares to expose a coherent and efficient workflow and a rich API for building web applications.

    This talk will give you the guided tour of Genie, introducing the MVC stack and its main components and showing you how to quickly bootstrap a new Genie app and how to easily implement CRUD operations to expose resources over the internet, in an efficient and secure manner. You will see how easy it is to use Genie's API in tandem with Julia's modules system to hook up your code - allowing you to focus on your software's value proposition instead of wasting precious time dealing with the low level details of transporting bytes over the wire.

    Our talk discusses the development and origin of LightGraphs, current features, and future developments. We introduce the package's major design choices in a historical context as a compromise between the three core LightGraphs goals of simplicity, performance, and flexibility. We highlight several areas where specific features of Julia have led to flexible and efficient implementations of graph algorithms.

    We will highlight our work in centrality measures, graph traversals, and spectral graph algorithms as examples of areas where Julia's performance and design decisions have allowed LightGraphs to provide best-in-class implementations of graph algorithms. We also discuss integration with other organizations – JuliaOpt for matching and flow problems, and the Julia data visualization ecosystem – and highlight specifically LightGraphs' potential to provide leadership on performant graph visualization.

    Finally, we speculate on the influence of Julia's focus on elegant parallel processing to future development of the package.

  title: "Using Parallel Computing for Macroeconomic Forecasting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York"
  type: lightning_talk
  abstract: >
    This talk will give an overview of how researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have implemented economic forecasting and other post-estimation analyses of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models using Julia’s parallel computing framework. This is part of the most recent release of our DSGE.jl package, following our ports of the DSGE model solution and estimation steps from MATLAB that were presented at JuliaCon in 2016. I will discuss the technical challenges and constraints we faced in our production environment and how we used Julia’s parallel computing tools to substantially reduce both the time and memory usage required to forecast our models. I will present our experiences with the different means of parallel computing offered in Julia - including an extended attempt at using DistributedArrays.jl - and discuss what we have learned about parallelization, both in Julia and in general.

    In addition, I will provide some of our new perspectives on using Julia in a production setting at an academic and policy institution. DSGE models are sometimes called the workhorses of modern macroeconomics, applying insights from microeconomics to inform our understanding of the economy as a whole. They are used to forecast economic variables, investigate counterfactual scenarios, and understand the impact of monetary policy. The New York Fed’s DSGE model is a large-scale model of the U.S. economy, which incorporates the zero lower bound, price/wage stickiness, financial frictions, and other realistic features of the economy. Solving, estimating, and forecasting it presents a series of high-dimensional problems which are well suited for implementation in Julia.

  title: "Equations, inequalities and global optimisation: guaranteed solutions using interval methods and constraint propagation"
  type: lightning_talk
  abstract: >
    How can we find all solutions of a system of nonlinear equations, the "feasible set" satisfied by a collection of 
    inequalities, or the global optimum of a complicated function? These are all known to be hard problems in numerical analysis.
    
    In this talk, we will show how to solve all of these problems, in a guaranteed way, using a collection of related methods
    based on interval arithmetic, provided by the `IntervalArithmetic.jl` package. The starting point is a simple
    dimension-independent bisection code, which can be enhanced in a variety of ways. This method is rigorous: it is 
    guaranteed to find all roots, or to find the global minimum, respectively.
    
    One key idea is the use of continuous constraint propagation, which allows us to remove large portions of the search space 
    that are infeasible. We will explain the basics of this method, in particular the 
    "forward-backward contractor", and describe the implementation in the `IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl` package.

    This package generates forward and backward code automatically from a Julia expression, using metaprogramming techniques. 
    These are combined into "contractors", i.e. operators that contract a box without removing any portion of the set of 
    interest. These, in turn, give 
    a rigorous answer to the question whether a given box lies inside the feasible set or not. In this way, a paving 
    (collection of boxes) is built up that approximates the set.

  type: talk
  abstract: >
    By default, Julia comes with a powerful REPL that itself is completely written in Julia.
    It has, among other things, tab completion, customizable keybindings and different prompt modes to use the shell or access the help system.
    However, with regards to visual customization there are not that many options for a user to tweak.
    To that end, I created the package OhMyREPL.jl.
    Upon loading, it hooks into the REPL and adds features such as syntax highlighting, matching bracket highlighting, functionality to modify input and output prompts and a new way of printing stacktraces and error messages.
    It also contains some non-visual features, like allowing text that has been copied from a REPL session to be directly pasted back into a REPL and quickly opening the location of stack frames from a stacktrace in an editor.
    The talk will give an overview of the different features, discuss which features managed to get upstreamed to Julia v0.6 and, if time allows, outline the internals of the package.

  type: workshop
  abstract: >
    Knet (pronounced "kay-net") is the Koç University deep learning framework implemented in Julia by Deniz Yuret and collaborators. Knet uses dynamic computational graphs generated at runtime for automatic differentiation of (almost) any Julia code. This allows machine learning models to be implemented by only describing the forward calculation (i.e. the computation from parameters and data to loss) using the full power and expressivity of Julia. The implementation can use helper functions, loops, conditionals, recursion, closures, tuples and dictionaries, array indexing, concatenation and other high level language features, some of which are often missing in the restricted modeling languages of static computational graph systems like Theano, Torch, Caffe and Tensorflow. GPU operation is supported by simply using the KnetArray type instead of regular Array for parameters and data. High performance is achieved using custom memory management and efficient GPU kernels.

    We present a family of three Julia packages that together constitute a complete framework to describe and solve rational expectation models in economics. Dolang.jl is an equation parser and compiler that understands how to compile latex-like strings describing systems of equations into efficient Julia functions for evaluating the levels or derivatives of the equations. Dolo.jl leverages Dolang and implements a variety of frontier algorithms for solving a wide class of discrete time, continuous control rational expectations models. Finally, Dyno.jl builds upon Dolang to implement a Julia prototype of the Matlab-based dynare software library used extensively throughout academia and the public sector to approximate the solution to and estimate rational expectations models.

  type: workshop
  abstract: >
    The QML.jl (https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) package enables using the QML markup language from the Qt library to build graphical user interfaces for Julia programs. The package follows the recommended Qt practices and promotes separation between the GUI code and application logic. After a short introduction of these principles, the first topic of this talk will be the basic communication between QML and Julia, which happens through Julia functions and data (including composite types) stored in context properties. Using just a few basic building blocks, this makes all of the QML widgets available for interaction with Julia. The next part of the talk deals with Julia-specific extensions, such as the Julia ListModel, interfacing with the display system and GLVisualize and GR.jl support. These features will be illustrated using live demos, based on the examples in the QML.jl repository. Finally, some ideas for extending and improving the package will be listed, soliciting many contributions hopefully.

    The target audience for this talk is anyone interested in developing GUIs for their Julia application with a consistent look on OS X, Linux and Windows. All user-facing code is pure Julia and QML, no C++ knowledge is required to use the package.

For my Ph.D., I worked on Coolfluid, a C++ framework for computational fluid dynamics with a domain specific language. My interest in Julia is sparked by its powerful metaprogramming functionality coupled with C++-like performance, together with much better accessibility for students. To ease the transition to Julia, we are working on making some C++ libraries available in Julia. The QML.jl package is part of this effort. We also use Julia in our daily teaching activities, to provide students with interactive solutions to exercises.

  title: "TaylorIntegration.jl: Taylor's Integration Method in Julia"
  type: lightning_talk
  abstract: >
    In this talk we shall present TaylorIntegration.jl, an ODE integration package using Taylor's method in Julia. The main idea of Taylor's method is to approximate locally the solution by means by a *high-order* Taylor expansion, whose coefficients are computed recursively using automatic differentiation techniques. One of the principal advantages of Taylor's method is that, whenever high accuracy is required, the order of the method can be increased, which is more efficient computationally than taking smaller time steps.
    The accuracy of Taylor's method permits to have round-off errors per integration step. Traditionally, it has been difficult to
    make a generic Taylor integration package, but Julia permits this beautifully. We shall present some examples of the application of this method to ODE integration, including the whole computation of the Lyapunov spectrum, use of jet transport techniques, and parameter sensitivity. Open issues related to improving performance will be described.

  title: "Stochastic Optimization Models on Power Systems"
  type: talk
  abstract: >
    We will present 3 tools for decision making under uncertainty in the power systems area: SDDP, a tool for optimal hourly operation of complex power systems; OptGen, a computational tool for determining the least-cost expansion of a multi-regional hydrothermal system; OptFlow, a mathematical model to optimize operation of a generation/transmission system with AC electrical network constraints.

    These models have been used by system operators, regulators and investors in more than seventy countries in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa, including some of the largest hydro based systems in the world, such as the Nordic pool, Canada, the US Pacific Northwest and Brazil. SDDP is also the model used by the World Bank staff in their planning studies of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.  OptGen had some interesting applications regional studies such as the interconnection of Central America, the Balkan regions, the interconnection of nine South American countries, Africa (Egypt-Sudan-Ethiopia and Morocco-Spain) and Central Asia.
    The original version of all 3 models was written in FORTRAN with the aid of some modelling tool or higher level API: AMPL for OptFlow, Mosel for OptGen and COIN-OR API for SDDP. Similar to any software, maintaining the code and adding new features became increasingly complex because they have to be built upon older data structures and program architectures.

    These concerns motivated PSR to develop an updated version of these programs written entirely in julia (with JuMP and MathProgBase) for three basic reasons: (i) the code is concise and very readable; (ii) the availability of an advanced optimization “ecosystem”; and (iii) excellent resources for distributed processing (CPUs and GPUs). We retained the use of Xpress by developing the Xpress.jl library. We also use MPI.jl for distributed processing (including multiple servers in AWS).

    The computational performance of the new code is matches the current ones’, which is very encouraging given that the current FORTRAN code has been optimized for several years based on thousands of studies. Also, the julia code incorporates several new modeling features that were easy to implement in all the 3 models: including SDP and SOCP relaxations for OPF and SDDiP method for stochastic integer optimization, confirming our expectation of faster model development.

    The new models were incorporated to an integrated planning system for Peru being developed by PSR, which will be delivered in August 2017. They are also being internally tested as a “shadow” to the current version for studies in several countries and was delivered for beta testing for some PSR clients. The official release is scheduled for the end of 2017.

Shearlab.jl is a already registered Julia package (https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl) based in the most used implementation of Shearlet Transform programmed in Matlab by the Research Group of Prof. Kutyniok (http://www.shearlab.org/software); improving it by at least double the speed on different experiments.

    As examples of applications of Shearlet Transform one has Image Denoising, Image Inpaiting and Video Compression; for instance I used it mainly to reconstruct the Light Field of a 3D Scene from Sparse Photographic Samples of Different Perspectives with Stereo Vision purposes. A lot of research institutes and companies have already adopted the Shearlet Transform in their work (e.g. Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin and Charité Hospital in Berlin, Mathematical Institute of TU Berlin) by its directional sensitivity, reconstruction stability and sparse representation.

    Julia is a language designed for numerical computing and it does that job pretty well. However, the emphasis on numerical computing and data science tends to overshadow the language’s other use cases. In this talk we share our experiences using Julia to build a distributed data fabric using commodity hardware. A data fabric is a distributed storage system that abstracts away the physical infrastructure and makes data available to applications using well known protocols such as NFS or S3. Our talk focuses on how we use Julia to implement a data fabric with specific examples. We will discuss some of the shortcomings and how we circumvented them. Finally we close by a cost benefit analysis of developing in Julia and how it can be a critical advantage in bringing products to market.
