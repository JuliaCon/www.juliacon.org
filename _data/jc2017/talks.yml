  title: "Full Stack Web Development with Genie.jl"
  abstract: >
    The web is eating the world, but building modern web applications can be an intimidating task. Successful online products must be fast, beautiful and usable. Responsive, maintainable and extendable. Provide simple and flexible web APIs. Be secure. Reach virtually 100% uptime while being easy to debug, extend and update, requiring powerful logging, intelligent caching and rapid scaling strategies.

    Julia as a language has an enormous potential in the web space thanks to its concise and friendly syntax, the powerful REPL, Unicode support, cross-platform availability, the efficiently compiled code and its parallel and distributed computing capabilities. And Julia's ecosystem already provides low level libraries like HttpServer and WebSockets. But they leave the developers having to spend large amounts of time writing glue and boilerplate code: a tedious, expensive and error prone task.

    Genie is a new web framework that leverages Julia's unique combination of features and its extensive collection of packages to empower developers to create high-performance web apps in less time and with less code. It glues low level libraries and contributes its own middlewares to expose a coherent and efficient workflow and a rich API for building web applications.

    This talk will give you the guided tour of Genie, introducing the MVC stack and its main components and showing you how to quickly bootstrap a new Genie app and how to easily implement CRUD operations to expose resources over the internet, in an efficient and secure manner. You will see how easy it is to use Genie's API in tandem with Julia's modules system to hook up your code - allowing you to focus on your software's value proposition instead of wasting precious time dealing with the low level details of transporting bytes over the wire.

  abstract: >
    Our talk discusses the development and origin of LightGraphs, current features, and future developments. We introduce the package's major design choices in a historical context as a compromise between the three core LightGraphs goals of simplicity, performance, and flexibility. We highlight several areas where specific features of Julia have led to flexible and efficient implementations of graph algorithms.

    We will highlight our work in centrality measures, graph traversals, and spectral graph algorithms as examples of areas where Julia's performance and design decisions have allowed LightGraphs to provide best-in-class implementations of graph algorithms. We also discuss integration with other organizations – JuliaOpt for matching and flow problems, and the Julia data visualization ecosystem – and highlight specifically LightGraphs' potential to provide leadership on performant graph visualization.

    Finally, we speculate on the influence of Julia's focus on elegant parallel processing to future development of the package.

  title: "Using Parallel Computing for Macroeconomic Forecasting at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York"
  abstract: >
    This talk will give an overview of how researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have implemented economic forecasting and other post-estimation analyses of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models using Julia’s parallel computing framework. This is part of the most recent release of our DSGE.jl package, following our ports of the DSGE model solution and estimation steps from MATLAB that were presented at JuliaCon in 2016. I will discuss the technical challenges and constraints we faced in our production environment and how we used Julia’s parallel computing tools to substantially reduce both the time and memory usage required to forecast our models. I will present our experiences with the different means of parallel computing offered in Julia - including an extended attempt at using DistributedArrays.jl - and discuss what we have learned about parallelization, both in Julia and in general.

    In addition, I will provide some of our new perspectives on using Julia in a production setting at an academic and policy institution. DSGE models are sometimes called the workhorses of modern macroeconomics, applying insights from microeconomics to inform our understanding of the economy as a whole. They are used to forecast economic variables, investigate counterfactual scenarios, and understand the impact of monetary policy. The New York Fed’s DSGE model is a large-scale model of the U.S. economy, which incorporates the zero lower bound, price/wage stickiness, financial frictions, and other realistic features of the economy. Solving, estimating, and forecasting it presents a series of high-dimensional problems which are well suited for implementation in Julia.

  title: "Solving Equations and Inequalities Using Constraint Propagation"
  abstract: >
    Continuous constraint propagation is a technique that allows us to calculate the "feasible set" satisfied by a collection of (in)equalities. We will explain the basic ideas of the method, in particular the "forward-backward contractor", and describe the implementation in the `IntervalConstraintProgramming.jl` package.

    This package generates forward and backward code automatically from a Julia expression, using metaprogramming techniques. It then uses interval arithmetic provided by the `ValidatedNumerics.jl` package to build contractors, that in turn give a rigorous answer to the question whether a given box lies inside the feasible set or not. In this way, a paving (collection of boxes) is built up that approximates the set.

    The package works, in principle, in any dimension, but solving problems in higher dimensions is much harder.

  abstract: >
    By default, Julia comes with a powerful REPL that itself is completely written in Julia.
    It has, among other things, tab completion, customizable keybindings and different prompt modes to use the shell or access the help system.
    However, with regards to visual customization there are not that many options for a user to tweak.
    To that end, I created the package OhMyREPL.jl.
    Upon loading, it hooks into the REPL and adds features such as syntax highlighting, matching bracket highlighting, functionality to modify input and output prompts and a new way of printing stacktraces and error messages.
    It also contains some non-visual features, like allowing text that has been copied from a REPL session to be directly pasted back into a REPL and quickly opening the location of stack frames from a stacktrace in an editor.
    The talk will give an overview of the different features, discuss which features managed to get upstreamed to Julia v0.6 and, if time allows, outline the internals of the package.

    Knet (pronounced "kay-net") is the Koç University deep learning framework implemented in Julia by Deniz Yuret and collaborators. Knet uses dynamic computational graphs generated at runtime for automatic differentiation of (almost) any Julia code. This allows machine learning models to be implemented by only describing the forward calculation (i.e. the computation from parameters and data to loss) using the full power and expressivity of Julia. The implementation can use helper functions, loops, conditionals, recursion, closures, tuples and dictionaries, array indexing, concatenation and other high level language features, some of which are often missing in the restricted modeling languages of static computational graph systems like Theano, Torch, Caffe and Tensorflow. GPU operation is supported by simply using the KnetArray type instead of regular Array for parameters and data. High performance is achieved using custom memory management and efficient GPU kernels.

    The QML.jl (https://github.com/barche/QML.jl) package enables using the QML markup language from the Qt library to build graphical user interfaces for Julia programs. The package follows the recommended Qt practices and promotes separation between the GUI code and application logic. After a short introduction of these principles, the first topic of this talk will be the basic communication between QML and Julia, which happens through Julia functions and data (including composite types) stored in context properties. Using just a few basic building blocks, this makes all of the QML widgets available for interaction with Julia. The next part of the talk deals with Julia-specific extensions, such as the Julia ListModel, interfacing with the display system and GLVisualize and GR.jl support. These features will be illustrated using live demos, based on the examples in the QML.jl repository. Finally, some ideas for extending and improving the package will be listed, soliciting many contributions hopefully.

    The target audience for this talk is anyone interested in developing GUIs for their Julia application with a consistent look on OS X, Linux and Windows. All user-facing code is pure Julia and QML, no C++ knowledge is required to use the package.

  title: "TaylorIntegration.jl: Taylor's Integration Method in Julia"
  abstract: >
    In this talk we shall present TaylorIntegration.jl, an ODE integration package using Taylor's method in Julia. The main idea of Taylor's method is to approximate locally the solution by means by a *high-order* Taylor expansion, whose coefficients are computed recursively using automatic differentiation techniques. One of the principal advantages of Taylor's method is that, whenever high accuracy is required, the order of the method can be increased, which is more efficient computationally than taking smaller time steps.
    The accuracy of Taylor's method permits to have round-off errors per integration step. Traditionally, it has been difficult to
    make a generic Taylor integration package, but Julia permits this beautifully. We shall present some examples of the application of this method to ODE integration, including the whole computation of the Lyapunov spectrum, use of jet transport techniques, and parameter sensitivity. Open issues related to improving performance will be described.

  title: "Stochastic Optimization Models on Power Systems"
  abstract: >
    We will present 3 tools for decision making under uncertainty in the power systems area: SDDP, a tool for optimal hourly operation of complex power systems; OptGen, a computational tool for determining the least-cost expansion of a multi-regional hydrothermal system; OptFlow, a mathematical model to optimize operation of a generation/transmission system with AC electrical network constraints.

    These models have been used by system operators, regulators and investors in more than seventy countries in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa, including some of the largest hydro based systems in the world, such as the Nordic pool, Canada, the US Pacific Northwest and Brazil. SDDP is also the model used by the World Bank staff in their planning studies of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.  OptGen had some interesting applications regional studies such as the interconnection of Central America, the Balkan regions, the interconnection of nine South American countries, Africa (Egypt-Sudan-Ethiopia and Morocco-Spain) and Central Asia.
    The original version of all 3 models was written in FORTRAN with the aid of some modelling tool or higher level API: AMPL for OptFlow, Mosel for OptGen and COIN-OR API for SDDP. Similar to any software, maintaining the code and adding new features became increasingly complex because they have to be built upon older data structures and program architectures.

    These concerns motivated PSR to develop an updated version of these programs written entirely in julia (with JuMP and MathProgBase) for three basic reasons: (i) the code is concise and very readable; (ii) the availability of an advanced optimization “ecosystem”; and (iii) excellent resources for distributed processing (CPUs and GPUs). We retained the use of Xpress by developing the Xpress.jl library. We also use MPI.jl for distributed processing (including multiple servers in AWS).

    The computational performance of the new code is matches the current ones’, which is very encouraging given that the current FORTRAN code has been optimized for several years based on thousands of studies. Also, the julia code incorporates several new modeling features that were easy to implement in all the 3 models: including SDP and SOCP relaxations for OPF and SDDiP method for stochastic integer optimization, confirming our expectation of faster model development.

    The new models were incorporated to an integrated planning system for Peru being developed by PSR, which will be delivered in August 2017. They are also being internally tested as a “shadow” to the current version for studies in several countries and was delivered for beta testing for some PSR clients. The official release is scheduled for the end of 2017.

    Julia is a language designed for numerical computing and it does that job pretty well. However, the emphasis on numerical computing and data science tends to overshadow the language’s other use cases. In this talk we share our experiences using Julia to build a distributed data fabric using commodity hardware.

Our talk focuses on how we use Julia to implement a data fabric with specific examples. We will discuss some of the shortcomings and how we circumvented them. Finally we close by a cost benefit analysis of developing in Julia and how it can be a critical advantage in bringing products to market.

  title: "Modia: A Domain Specific Extension of Julia for Modeling and Simulation"
  abstract: >
    Modeling of physical systems (electrical, mechanical, thermo-dynamical, etc.) are made by differential and algebraic equations, i.e. expression=expression. An example is Newton's equation. Julia allows such a syntax and provides meta-programming to symbolically solve equations and JIT compile them. These properties enabled defining a powerful domain specific language for modeling and simulation called Modia. The authors used previous experience from the design of the modeling language Modelica (www.Modelica.org). Component models are defined by @model macros. Such models contain definition of variables with various attributes such as start values, min, max, SI unit, etc. An @equations macro is used to define the equations of such a component. Coupling between components is expressed using a connect statement involving groups of variables. The semantics is either to constrain connected variables to be equal or to constrain a set of variables to sum to zero, for example to model Kirchhoff's current law. By these constructs it's possible and convenient to build models with hundred thousands of equations describing the dynamics of a car, an airplane, a power plant, etc.

    The talk will give an introduction to the Modia extension of Julia and the semantics. An overview of graph theoretical algorithms for sorting equations and symbolic algorithms for solving and differentiating equations will be given. Numeric solution is made by an extension to Sundials IDA solver with the KLU sparse matrix package.

    The plan is to make the implementation public domain on Github in May 2017.

His Ph.D. thesis contains the design of a novel object-oriented model language called Dymola and algorithms for symbolic model manipulation. It introduced a new modeling methodology based on connecting submodels according to the corresponding physical connections instead of signal flows. Submodels were described declaratively by equations instead of assignment statements.

    Elmqvist spent one year in 1978-1979 at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, California. His research continued in 1979-1984 on languages for implementation of control systems (LICS) and for visual modeling (HIBLIZ). Elmqvist was in 1984-1990 the principal designer and project manager at a subsidiary to Alfa-Laval called SattControl in Malmö for developing SattGraph, a user interface system for process control and SattLine, a graphical, object-oriented and distributed control system. In 1990-1992, he worked for Alfa-Laval in Toronto.

    In 1992, Elmqvist founded Dynasim AB in Lund, Sweden. The company developed software tools for modeling, simulation and design of large dynamical systems. The primary product is Dymola for object-oriented modeling allowing graphical composition of models and 3D visualization of model dynamics.

    Elmqvist took the initiative in 1996 to organize an international effort to design the next generation object-oriented language for physical modeling, Modelica. The Dymola software has support for the Modelica language since 1998.

    In April 2006, Dynasim AB was acquired by Dassault Systemes. The Dymola/Modelica technology is central for their new strategy on CATIA Systems. Elmqvist was the worldwide Chief Technology Officer for CATIA Systems within Dassault Systèmes until December 2015.

    Systems Biologists in the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) [7] community are gearing up to develop computational models of large and huge-scale biochemical networks with more than one million biochemical reactions. The growing model size puts a strain on efficient simulation and network exploration times to the point that accelerating existing COBRA methods became a priority. Flux balance analysis and its variants are widely used methods for predicting steady-state reaction rates in biochemical reaction networks. The exploration of high dimensional networks has long been hampered by performance limitations of current implementations in Matlab/C (The COBRA Toolbox [8] and fastFVA [3]) or Python (cobrapy [2]). Julia [1] is the language that fills the gap between complexity, performance, and development time. DistributedFBA.jl [4], part of the novel COBRA.jl package, is a high-level, high-performance, open-source Julia implementation of flux balance analysis, which is a linear optimization problem. It is tailored to solve multiple flux balance analyses on a subset or all the reactions of large and huge-scale networks, on any number of threads or nodes using optimization solver interfaces implemented in MathProgBase.jl [5]. Julia's parallelization capabilities led to a speedup in latency that follows Amdahl's law. For the first time, a flux variability analysis (two flux balance analyses on each biochemical reaction) on a model with more than 200k biochemical reactions [6] has been performed. With Julia and COBRA.jl, the reconstruction and analysis capabilities of large and huge-scale models in the COBRA community are lifted to another level.

  title: "Mixed-Mode Automatic Differentiation in Julia"
  abstract: >
    Julia's unique execution model, metaprogramming facilities, and type system make it an ideal candidate language for native automatic differentiation (AD). In this talk, we'll discuss a variety of Julia-specific tricks employed by ForwardDiff and ReverseDiff to differentiate user-provided Julia functions. Topics covered include the implementation of a native Julia execution tracer via operator overloading, functor-based directives for specialized instruction taping, SIMD vectorization and instruction elision for inlined dual number operations, and vectorized differentiation of linear algebraic expressions. I'll close the talk with a glimpse into the future of AD in Julia and JuMP, highlighting the effect new features may have on other downstream projects like Celeste, Optim and RigidBodyDynamics.

  title: "Julia: The Type of Language for Mathematical Programming"
  abstract: >
    Julia was designed to be the right language for programming mathematics. In this talk, I’ll argue that its sophisticated type system allows mathematicians to program in the same way they write mathematics. This simplicity has two consequences. First, it has made Julia an attractive ecosystem in which to write mathematical packages: Julia is now the language with the most comprehensive, robust, and user-friendly ecosystem of packages for mathematical programming (or optimization, in modern lingo). Second, it has made Julia the right language in which to express many mathematical problems. The lightweight type system makes it easy to write code that is clearer than pseudocode.

    This talk will present three case studies in optimization. We hope the audience will leave the talk with a new appreciation of Julia’s type system, as well as a new toolkit of packages to use for data fitting and optimization.

    1. Convex is a widely used library for convex optimization in Julia. In that package, the type system is used to create and recursively analyze the abstract syntax tree representing an optimization problem. Notions such as the sign of a real number, or the convexity or concavity of a function, are represented as types; and the convexity of an expression can be analyzed using a simple recursion over the tree of types.

    2. LowRankModels is a statistical package for imputing missing entries in large, heterogeneous tabular data set. LowRankModels uses type information about a DataFrame to automatically select the appropriate optimization problem to solve in order to find the best completion for the data table. These optimization problems are parametrized by a set of loss functions and regularizers. Using the type system, we are able to write algorithms that work seamlessly for any loss function or regularizer a user may dream up.

    3. Sketched approximations are a class of fast algorithms for producing a low rank approximation to a matrix - like an eigenvalue decomposition, but faster. We’ll show how to use parametric types to write all the special cases of the algorithm without introducing redundant code. Notably, these parametric types make it easier to understand the flow of the algorithm, and have essentially no analogue in “pseudocode” notation. Together with Julia’s simple mathematical syntax and support for unicode (eg, Greek) letters, we’ll see that the Julia code functions not only as an implementation of the method, but as a better version of pseudocode.

    By many measures, TensorFlow has grown over the last year to become the most popular library for training machine-learning models. TensorFlow.jl provides Julia with a simple yet feature-rich interface to TensorFlow that takes advantage of Julia's multiple dispatch, just-in-time compilation, and metaprogramming capabilities to provide unique capabilities exceeding TensorFlow's own native Python API.
    This talk will demonstrate TensorFlow.jl by guiding listeners through training a realistic model of image captioning , showing how to 1) construct the model with native Julia control flow and indexing, 2) visualize the model structure and parameters in a web browser during training,  and 3) seamlessly save and share the trained model with Python. No prior experience with TensorFlow is assumed.

  title: "HiFrames: High Performance Distributed Data Frames in Julia"
  abstract: >
    Data frames are essential tools for data scientists, but existing data frames packages in Julia (and other languages) are sequential and do not scale to large data sets. Alternatively, data frames in distributed frameworks such as Spark are slow and not integrated with other computations flexibly. We propose a novel compiler-based approach where we integrate data frames into the High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT) to build HiFrames. It automatically parallelizes and compiles relational operations along with other array computations in end-to-end data analytics programs, and generates efficient MPI/C++ code. We demonstrate that HiFrames is significantly faster than alternatives such as Spark on clusters, without forcing the programmer to switch to embedded SQL for part of the program. HiFrames is 3.6x to 70x faster than Spark SQL for basic relational operations, and can be up to 20,000x faster for advanced analytics operations, such as weighted moving averages (WMA), that the map-reduce paradigm cannot handle effectively. We will discuss how Julia’s powerful macro and compilation system facilitates developing HiFrames.

  title: "Turing: a Fresh Approach to Probabilistic Programming"
  abstract: >
    Turing is a new probabilistic programming language (PPL) based on Julia, a framework which allows users to define probabilistic models and perform inference automatically. Thanks to Julia's meta-programming support, Turing has a very friendly front-end modelling interface. Meanwhile, coroutines are used in Turing's inference engine development to achieve the state-of-the-art sampling performance. Also, we have recently introduced a new Gibbs interface, which allows user to compose different samplers and run them in the same time. In this talk, we will discuss our motivation of developing Turing in Julia, introduce the design and architecture of Turing, and present some practical examples of how probabilistic modelling is performed in Turing.

I plan to briefly explain how the new system works and what you can do with it. But more importantly, I want to ask: where do we go from here? Will we ever need another overhaul? I'll present some possible future features and other related speculations. Topics may include record types, more powerful tuple types, protocols, ugly corner cases, and method specificity and ambiguity.

    This talk covers the design and implementation of Pkg3, the third (and hopefully final!) major iteration of Julia's built-in package manager. We'll begin with some history: what worked and didn't work in the two previous iterations of the package manager. Pkg3 tries to marry the better parts of systems like Python's virtualenv and Rust's cargo, while supporting federated and layered package registries, and supporting interactive usage as well as reproducible environments and reliable deployment of code in production. We'll nerd out a bit with some graph theory and how difficult it is to select compatible sets of package versions, and how much harder still it is to make version resolution understandable and predictable. But it won't be all theory – we'll also cover imminently practical subjects like "how do I install packages?"

  title: "AoT or JIT : How Does Julia Work?"
  abstract: >
    Julia uses a unique mix of techniques adopted from conventional static and dynamic to provide a special blend of high-performance and flexible compute kernels. This allows it to simultaneously have a fully ahead-of-time-compiled code model – while permitting (even encouraging) code updates at runtime – and a fully runtime-interpreted interface – while permitting extensive compile-time optimization. In this talk, I will examine some of the trade-offs and limitations this requires of user code, especially on common first-class code evaluation features – such as `eval` and incremental pre-compilation – as well as advanced features – such as `@generated` functions and `@pure`. We will also try to take a look at the internal layout and implementation of some of these data structures, and how the compiler works to maintain their correctness over time, despite other changes to the system.

  title: "Taking Vector Transposes Seriously"
  abstract: >
    from @jiahao:

    We have really thought carefully about what the transpose of a vector should mean in a programming language. The pre-0.6 behavior that vector'vector yields a vector, vector' yields a matrix, and vector'' yields a matrix are all bad mathematics and produced no shortage of confusion by end users.

    I present a summary of our research at the MIT Julia Labs into issue #4774, as a language design question that is informed by a comprehensive understanding of user expectations. Our main result is a short proof that it is impossible to avoid either new types, "ugly mathematics" (violation of Householder notation) or type instability. A single Array type is incompatible with Householder notation that produces the expected types from typical linear algebraic expressions. Furthermore, Householder notation intrinsically requires a conflation of 1x1 matrices and true scalars.

    I also provide historical evidence the notion of "ugly mathematics" is neither static nor objective. In reality, linear algebra has changed greatly over the past centuries, demonstrating the impermanence of even elementary concepts of what matrices and vectors are and how they have been influenced by notation - a discussion forced into consciousness through the lens of programming language design, types, and formal program semantics.

    I review the resolution of #19670 in the context of other designs in other programming languages, showing that all these designs turn out to locally optimal in conflating as much of Householder notation and array semantics as possible.

  title: "Using Julia to Bridge Research and Production Environments for an On-demand Delivery Network"
  abstract: >
    Quickly moving ideas from research to implementation has always been challenging, usually requiring intensive code rewrites that impede development or constrain research ideas considered too time-intensive to implement.  Homer Logistics is an on-demand delivery provider whose systems power more than 100,000 monthly deliveries across 11 markets across the United States.  We have used Julia extensively to bridge the gap between research and implementation to improve and iterate our methods as quickly as possible.

    Because of Julia’s flexibility, package library for optimization, and strong performance, we can repurpose much of our research code from a simulated environment for our production systems.  In production, we use a collection of Julia microservices built from Docker images that are then deployed and managed using Kubernetes.  The Julia microservices function as specialized computational engines for different components of the delivery network, helping us solve tens of thousands of linear programs daily to remain dynamically responsive to our on-demand environment.  These microservices communicate with other systems using Redis and HTTP.  We will talk about our experience using Julia in research and production and challenges that are our concerns for continuing to use Julia in the future.

  title: "Event-based Simulation of Spiking Neural Networks in Julia"
  abstract: >
    Information in the brain is processed by the coordinated activity of large neural circuits. Neural network models help to understand, for example, how biophysical features of single neurons and the network topology shape the collective circuit dynamics. This requires solving large systems of coupled differential equations which is numerically challenging.

    Here, we introduce a novel efficient method for numerically exact simulations of sparse neural networks that bring to bear Julia’s different data structures and high performance. The new algorithm reduces the computational cost from O(N) to O(log(N)) operations per network spike. This is achieved by mapping the neural dynamics to pulse-coupled phase oscillators and using mutable binary heaps for efficient state updates.
    Thereby numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and the characterization of their chaotic phase space structure become possible. For example, calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent of a spiking neural network with one million neurons is sped up by more than four orders of magnitude compared to previous implementations in other programming languages (C++, Python, Matlab).
