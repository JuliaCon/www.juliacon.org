# Code of Conduct

JuliaCon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, age, religion, text editor choice, or tabs vs spaces
preference.  We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
in any form. Offensive or sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any conference venue, including formal talks and
networking between sessions. Conference participants violating these
rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference (without a
refund) at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and
  expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
  body size, race, age, or religion
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior


## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the
event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes
warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
refund. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed
to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
environment hostile for any participants.  We expect participants to
follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social
activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event
activities too!


## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to
be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better
place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

<!--
### Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report here [Wufoo form or similar that DOES
NOT require an email address to submit.]

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will
fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent
a recurrence.

### Personal Report

You can make a personal report by calling or messaging this phone
number: (TBD) or this email address
juliacon@googlegroups.com (private group of the committee).
This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and
cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your
report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about
what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as
respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support
you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone
who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local
law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise
assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your
attendance.
