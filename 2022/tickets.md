# JuliaCon 2022: Registration

Tickets will be free, but registration is required to access the conference.
Free registration will give you access to all the workshops and talks. We also ask that if you have the means, you 
"Buy" a ticket which will serve as a donation to the project. Donations are not required but go to support initatives like 
Julia Summer of Code, D&I, Infra, and much more!
