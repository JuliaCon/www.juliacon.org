# Memories of JuliaCon past

### 2021

JuliaCon continued online in 2021, and so we again asked our attendees to upload a photo of their hometown. Here once again is a collage representing the world wide nature of the Julia community.

### 2020

JuliaCon moved online in 2020, and so we could not arrange the traditional group photo. We did however ask our attendees to upload a photo of the place they were joining from. Here is a collage, representing our global audience.

### 2019

The number of our attendees grew enough that we had to hire a drone to take the photo. Here we are in sunny Baltimore.

### 2015

With increasing interest, JuliaCon was held at MIT, the home of Julia. Here we are, with the angles of the [Ghery's Stata Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center) behind us.

### 2014

The first JuliaCon was held in Chicago, where nearly 80 early adopters came together to talk about this then new programming language. The rest is history!
