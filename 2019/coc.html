<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
  <p>
    JuliaCon is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience
    for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
    age, religion, or national and ethnic origin. We encourage respectful
    and considerate interactions between attendees and do not tolerate
    harassment of conference participants in any form. For example, offensive
    or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference
    venue, including formal talks and networking between sessions. Conference
    participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from
    the conference (without a refund) at the discretion of the conference organizers.

    Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li> Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion
      <li> Sexual images in public spaces
      <li> Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
      <li> Harassing photography or recording
      <li> Sustained disruption of talks or other events
      <li> Inappropriate physical contact
      <li> Unwelcome sexual attention
      <li> Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Enforcement</h2>
  <p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
    comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
    event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the
    event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes
    warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no
    refund. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed
    to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the
    environment hostile for any participants.  We expect participants to
    follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social
    activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event
    activities too!
  </p>

  <h2>Reporting</h2>
  <p>
    If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
    report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
    violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to
    be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better
    place. You can make a report either personally or anonymously.
  </p>

  <h3>Personal Report</h3>
  <p>
    A phone number and email address to report CoC violations or discuss
    any incident that may have left you uncomfortable will be provided
    closer to the conference date. This number and email address will be
    continuously monitored for the duration of the event.

    When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and
    cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your
    report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about
    what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as
    respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support
    you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone
    who you are.

    Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local
    law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise
    assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your
    attendance.
