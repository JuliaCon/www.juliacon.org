## On the day volunteers

JuliaCon volunteers are the backbone of our conference and without people like you, we would not be able to make JuliaCon the success it is!

ðŸ‘· Example volunteer duties:
- Check-in at registration desk 
- Ensure talks start and end on time
- Answer or appropriately redirect questions from attendees and speakers
- Appropriately redirect any Code of Conduct complaints
- Manage maximum room capacity
- Helping with any ad hoc needs

**Please note: we are asking that you devote about 50% of your time at the conference helping with any of the tasks that need to be done.**

## Mentors to new speakers

JuliaCon 2024 will match first-time JuliaCon speakers desiring guidance to experienced speakers willing to mentor.
We are expecting a time commitment of maximally a few hours in which mentors will provide feedback on a novice speaker's presentation.

Please let us know if you would like to be mentored or if you are willing to mentor a first-time speaker for JuliaCon 2024!

## Proceedings reviewers

JuliaCon offers proceedings, and we need reviewers to assess submissions.
Our review process is similar to that of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). You can register as reviewer by filling [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOvN0cEQRJZ_fIXbkPBJBJTNvzSyy89khrQvv8i0NSXmLkFA/viewform). More information about JuliaCon proceedings can be found [here](https://proceedings.juliacon.org/).

### Joining the Committee

Each year, the previous years JuliaCon committee is usually asked to return. If certain members are no longer able to continue in their role, the existing committee members will work to find a replacement. JuliaCon committee members are generally folks who have been long term contributors to the community or made significant contributors in recent years. Generally, the JuliaCon Chair/co-chair's lead the effort to recruit committee members.

The committee is also open to nominations (you can nominate yourself) for vacant positions or positions that do not exist but you think would provide value to the conference. Nominations are accepted on a rolling basis and reviewed by the current committee as needed. While many current committee members have been long term Julia contributors, this is not a hard requirement. Being a long term member of the community comes with its blind spots, so if there is a unique angle you believe your nominee (including yourself) brings to the table, we would love to hear more!

[Here is the Nomination form](https://forms.gle/yaLKyrGew2KSo1WJ8).
