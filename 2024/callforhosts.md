# JuliaCon 2025 Call for Hosts

The JuliaCon Executive Committee will consider proposals to host JuliaCon 2025. Following the usual JuliaCon rotation of locations (alternating between the Americas and Europe), JuliaCon 2025 is planned to be held in the US or the Americas. Proposals must be from active researchers or other community members, not from a conference management entity. Proposers must have had previous JuliaCon experience (for example, participation in the conference, volunteering at the conference including serving on the program committee, etc.). Selected proposals will be asked to submit further details and will be advised in its preparation. Proposals should be brief (2 to four pages) and should contain information on:

- the site (local infrastructure, hotels and venues to consider that can accommodate JuliaCon requirements and travel connections, as well as Audio/Visual availability and constraints),

- the local organization team (the local chair(s) and key volunteers, their experience in running conferences, or meetups, their prior experience with JuliaCon, their experience with Julia and the Julia community) and

- key budget item estimates (including hotel room rates, meeting space cost, catering costs, etc.). These do not have to be proper quotes for the initial proposal, but should reflect typical expenses in your area.

Proposals should be emailed to [raye@julialang.org](mailto:raye@julialang.org)

### Responsibilities

The executive committee appoints the program chair(s), finance chair(s), sponsorship chair(s), proceedings chair(s) and DEI chair(s) and other global committee positions. The local committee is typically responsible for:

- Solicitation and early negotation of the venue (which may or may not be a hotel or conference center. Often university's provide adequate venues).
- Solicitation and management of local vendors including but not limited to catering, audiovisual services, print services, hotels and accommodations, and merchandise services.
- Coordination with other local entities including local government, local user groups and general software development inclusion groups, tourism/commerce boards, local academic centers, etc.

- Conference week responsibilities including volunteer management, booth and conference floor layout and management, signage (potentially designed by the global committee), audiovisual management, shipping and handling, etc.
- Visa letters which may be required for entry by international attendees

The global committee is typically responsible for:

- Program: Call for proposals, proposal review, scheduling etc.
- Finance: Final contract negotiations, management of resources, approval of spending, ticket sales.
- Sponsorship: Coordination with existing sponsors and soliciting new sponsors.
- Proceedings: Management and publication of JuliaCon Proceedings.
- DEI: Ensuring that the conference remains inclusive and available to the widest range of community members. Management of JuliaCon scholarships, diversity events, and conference conduct incidents.

The local committee is free to determine the extent of its involvement in global committee responsibilities.

### Evaluation Criteria

The proposal may include, as appendices, brochures or other printed material concerning the locale and conference facilities, if these are available. The global committee will negotiate with proposed hotel venues directly, if the venue is a university or similar entity the local chairs may be involved in this negotiation. The proposal will be evaluated using the following criteria:

- Economic viability
- Community and/or academic reputation of key volunteers
- Level of commitment
- Transport and accessibility, especially for international travelers
- Maintaining a balance between different locations
- Experience of the organizers in hosting conferences
- Size of the Julia community in the area

JuliaCon is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion, in all of its activities, and aims to recruit volunteers representative of the diversity of the Julia community as well as the broader software development and research communities.
