JuliaCon 2024 will attempt provide financial assistance to those who wish to attend but for whom it is financially infeasible. A portion of sponsorship money will be set aside for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, including providing free tickets and travel assistance to diverse attendees. Awards are based on financial need, contributions by the applicant to their community and the broader Julia community. Priority will be given to speakers, so please submit a proposal to speak even if you arenâ€™t sure of the financial feasibility of attending right now. Check back here on February 13th for the application!

Financial assistance cannot be guaranteed at this time, but we will do what we can.

## Childcare

We plan to have on-site childcare at JuliaCon 2024 for children between the ages of 0-12. When you purchase your ticket there is an option to sign up for one of the available JuliaCare childcare slots! We hope that this will allow increased attendance and participation from parents of young children. As we approach the conference those who signed up will be contacted with more details.
